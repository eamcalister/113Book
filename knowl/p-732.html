<li><div class="para">First, notice that the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept is at <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\text{.}\)</span> This is due to the fact that <span class="process-math">\(f(0) = 2(1.5)^0\text{.}\)</span> Since any nonzero number raised to the zero power is <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we are just multiplying <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We also can notice this function is increasing as you move from left to right. In fact, you can see that each point we plotted is exactly one and a half times higher above the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis than the point that was plotted one unit to its left. This is because the height is multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> each time the input increases by one unit.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If we move from right to left through negative values of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> all the outputs are less than <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and getting smaller. This isn't a truly different observation than the last one, but it's a different perspective. This comes from the fact that when <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is negative, we're really dividing by positive powers of <span class="process-math">\(1.5\text{.}\)</span> (Review you exponent rules now if you need to.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Finally, we notice that the outputs stay above the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This is because <span class="process-math">\((1.5)^t\)</span> is always positive, as it represents repeated multiplication of a positive number. If the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in front were replaced by a negative number, then the output would never be positive. Exponential functions never change signs.</div></li>
