<div class="para">When working with any family of functions, two common tasks are finding a formula for a member of some specified family satisfying some conditions (often points on the graph), and solving equations involving members of that family. A little reflection on the last two families we studied (exponential and power functions) reveals that we did not solve equations involving exponential functions nor did we find formulas for power functions. This is because we need a way of solving for a variable in an exponent, which is exactly what <em class="emphasis">logarithms are for.</em>
