<div class="para">One of the primary goals of Calculus is to investigate how functions behave at inputs “at the boundary” of the domain, hence we must be able to determine the domain. In order to determine the domain of a function, it is good to read it as a sequence of procedures, then decide if anything is not allowed at any point in that process. Those values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that force us into an operation that is not allowed with normal arithmetic are the values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that are not in the domain. For functions defined algebraically, the main things that are not allowed are:</div>
