<div class="para">Let's consider a candidate quadratic function <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = at^2+bt+c\text{.}\)</span> In order to find the rate of change of the rate of change (let's call this quantity acceleration), we must first find its rate of change for a small change, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{,}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> To figure this out, let's think flexibly about the terms of <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> as areas being summed up. The constant term, <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> can represent a <span class="process-math">\(1\times c\)</span> rectangle, which does not change at all for a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\)</span> change in <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> The term <span class="process-math">\(bt\)</span> can represent a <span class="process-math">\(b\times t\)</span> rectangle. If the side of length <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> increases by <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{,}\)</span> the area increases by <span class="process-math">\(b\Delta t\)</span> as in the following figure:</div>
