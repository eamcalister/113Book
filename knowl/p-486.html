<div class="para">As seen in part (c) of the last question, some numbers may not appear as outputs of a given function. The set of numbers that <em class="emphasis">do</em> appear as outputs of a given function is called the <dfn class="terminology">range</dfn> of the function. Another way to say what the range of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is, is that it is the set of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that there is a solution to the equation <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\text{.}\)</span> Finding the range of a function is generally a more difficult task than finding its domain; being able to find the maximum and/or minimum possible outputs of a given function is one of the main achievements of Calculus. However, in many cases we can determine the range of an algebraically defined function by some combination of the following:</div>
