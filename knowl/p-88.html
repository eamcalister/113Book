<div class="para">A very common task in physics or chemistry classes involves converting between units of measurement of quantities of the same dimension. The simplest way to do this is to treat the units of measurement as numbers multiplied by the numerical quantity in those units. So if we say a rod is two meters long, we would write the mathematical expression</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{length} = 2 \mbox{m},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\mbox{m}\)</span> is the abbreviation for meters multiplied by the number <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Since the unit name (the label) is multiplied by a number it is a factor in that expression. This is why we call this treatment of unit names as numbers the <em class="emphasis">factor-label method</em>. By treating the units as number, we can use our prior knowledge of arithmetic operations to make conversions.</div>
