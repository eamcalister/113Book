<div class="para">This distinction of what is done to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by these families is deeper than just where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is as a symbol; it tells us which operation must be applied to undo each process. In the both cases, undoing the function first involves division (by <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>). Then, in the case of a power function, you undo raising <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to the <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-th power by taking the <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>-th root (equivalently, raising to the <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{p}\)</span>-th power). In the case of the exponential function, we must undo exponentiation with a logarithm.</div>
