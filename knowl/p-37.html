<div class="para">Multiplication of real numbers is more difficult to visualize geometrically than addition or subtraction. The fundamental idea is that of stretching, with <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> being a basic unit of measurement. Let's start with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> being any positive number and <span class="process-math">\(a=1.5\text{.}\)</span> We see that <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> fits into <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> exactly <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> times. Since <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> must have the same size relative to <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> does to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must fit into <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> exactly <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> times. Think of this as stretching <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(a&gt;1\text{.}\)</span>
