<div class="para">What if we need to solve an equation with more than one variable? For instance, consider the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x+3y  = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">For such an equation, a solution is a <em class="emphasis">pair</em> of numbers, an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value and a <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value, that make the equation true when they are both plugged in at the same time. We see that if <span class="process-math">\(y=1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x=-3\)</span> makes the equation true. If <span class="process-math">\(y=2\text{,}\)</span> then the correct value for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-6\text{.}\)</span> Clearly we could go on like this, obtaining a different value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for any given value of <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> There is no way for us to say that this equation has a single solution; it has infinitely many. Often in problems the number of solutions is narrowed down by having more equations, which we call a <em class="emphasis">system of equations</em>. For instance, we may consider the system</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
x+3y \amp = \amp 0\\
2x-y \amp = \amp 1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">A solution to this system of two equations is again a pair of numbers, one for each variable, that make all the equations true at the same time. For instance <span class="process-math">\(x=-3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> is not a solution to this system; this pair makes the first equation true, but not the second. The pair <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> makes the second equation true, but not the first, so this is also not a solution to the system.**</div>
