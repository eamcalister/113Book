<div class="para">In this graph, we never see negative outputs because the exponent is even. However, we also never see zero as an output because a fraction is only zero when its numerator is zero at the same time its denominator is not zero. The most conspicuous behavior of this function is that as <span class="process-math">\(|x|\)</span> gets large, <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\to 0\)</span> and as <span class="process-math">\(|x|\)</span> gets close to zero, <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\to \infty\text{.}\)</span> This is a simple consequence of arithmetic; if you divide by a large number, the result is small and if you divide by a positive number very close to zero, the result is very large.</div>
