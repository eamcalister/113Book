<div class="para">Often it will be best to think of fractions as units of length (like when we think of numbers as positions on a line), but they could be areas, volumes, etc. Here we will think of the number <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> as the basic unit of measurement. Then a <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span>-th is the unit that goes into the basic unit <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> times. For instance, if we are thinking of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> foot, then <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{12}\)</span> is one inch because there are 12 inches in one foot.</div>
