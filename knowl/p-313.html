<div class="para">Now we will go backward from expanding/distributing. This process is known as factoring. When we expand an expression, we write it as an equivalent expression that is a sum of simple terms that each only involve multiplication and/or division. To <dfn class="terminology">factor</dfn> an expression means to write it as a product of simple terms. For example, earlier in this chapter we had two expressions for the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C in terms of the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F. The expression <span class="process-math">\(C = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{160}{9}\)</span> is in expanded form, while <span class="process-math">\(C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)\)</span> is in factored form. Factored forms of expressions are often useful for solving equations as we'll see in the next chapter. Factoring isn't something that can be done in all cases by a single procedure; the following are just a few examples of common factoring methods.</div>
