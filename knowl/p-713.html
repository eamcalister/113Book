<div class="para">One of the most important applications of quadratic functions comes as a prelude to really doing differential Calculus. The application is modeling the motion of objects with constant acceleration. It was Galileo Galilei who reasoned that all massive objects objects accelerate at the same constant rate when dropped, no matter what the mass is (neglecting air resistance). What we would like to do is construct a function that gives the height of a dropped object <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> seconds after it was dropped. What type of function should we use? We know that linear functions have a constant rate of change, thus if a linear function is used to describe the position of a moving object, that object's velocity must be constant. This would mean its acceleration must be zero. To model an object whose acceleration is a nonzero constant, we must construct a function whose <em class="emphasis">rate of change</em> changes at a constant rate.</div>
