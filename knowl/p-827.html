<div class="para">One of the major difficulties of logarithms is that they cannot easily be computed by hand unless the input is an obvious power of the base; a calculator is usually required. However, there are only two logarithms programmed into most calculators, the <em class="emphasis">common logarithm and the</em>natural logarithm. The common logarithm has a base of ten and the natural logarithm has a base of <span class="process-math">\(e \approx 2.718\text{.}\)</span> We will focus our use on the common logarithm. We will see in the next section that you really only need one logarithm.**</div>
