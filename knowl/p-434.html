<div class="para">Because we can think of algebraic expressions as processes carried out on variables, we may also think of a function as a process performed on <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> resulting in <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Equipped with the idea of equivalence of algebraic expressions, we may think of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in a more conceptual way. We can think of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as a factory that takes <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s as raw ingredients and makes specific <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>'s. Equivalence of the defining expressions for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can be thought of as rearranging the factory, but ultimately leaving the product being produced unchanged.</div>
