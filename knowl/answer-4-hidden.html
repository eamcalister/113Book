<body class="ignore-math"><div class="answer solution-like"> Suppose our parent function is <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k&gt;1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(y = kf(x)\)</span> has a graph that is that of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> except stretched away from the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This is due to the geometric representation of multiplication by numbers greater than one being represented as a stretch away from zero.
