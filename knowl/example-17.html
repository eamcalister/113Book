</h4>Let's see another reason unlike terms can't be combined. Consider the expression <span class="process-math">\(4x^3+ 6x\text{.}\)</span> To make it more meaningful, we may think of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a length with units of meters. Then <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> represents a volume in cubic meters. Because of dimensional considerations, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> cannot be combined in a meaningful way. In order for this expression to make any practical sense when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in meters, the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> needs to be in square meters. However, then the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> is dimensionless, while the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> represents an area. We cannot add the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> since they represent different units. So thinking of <span class="process-math">\(4x^3 + 6x\)</span> as representing some geometric quantity shows that it cannot be simplified any further.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="Sec2_2_equivalent-expressions.html#example-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
