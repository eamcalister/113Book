<body class="ignore-math"><article class="question example-like"><div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Sometimes the context of a problem restricts the domain of a function when the algebra may not. For instance, suppose a farmer wants to fence off a rectangular area with three sides of a rectangle, using a river as the fourth side. He has 100 yards of fence to use. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> denote the length of the side of the rectangle parallel to the river. Find a formula for the function <span class="process-math">\(A(x)\)</span> that gives the area as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> What is the domain of this function based on the formula and what is it based on the context of the problem?</em></div></article></body>
