<div class="para">Since there are infinitely many numbers to check, and equations may be complicated, it would be impossible to proceed by just guessing and checking to find solutions. Thus we want a (sort of) systematic approach to solving equations. We also see from the example above that equations may have multiple solutions, so we also want to know if we have found all of the solutions. Usually this gets answered on a case by case basis. We will look at some important examples in this chapter.</div>
