<div class="para">One thing we usually try to find is the least common denominator between two fractions. Thinking in terms of units, this is like finding the largest possible unit that goes into both quantities evenly. In the example given above we could have used <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span> to go into <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{5}\)</span> evenly and obtained</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{5}+\frac{1}{2} = \frac{22}{20}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">However, that makes the numbers we are dealing with larger for no reason. This would be like converting both ropes and yards into inches; itâ€™s possible, but unnecessary.</div>
