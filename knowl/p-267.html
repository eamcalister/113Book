<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">People who are good at algebra often speak of manipulating/simplifying algebraic expressions and putting expressions into different forms. What they are talking about is replacing an expression with an equivalent expression. The reason for manipulating expressions is that sometimes one version of an expression makes it easier to see a solution to a problem. For instance, the expression used to find the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C given the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{160}{9},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C. Suppose we want to know what temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(0^{\circ}\)</span>C. Even if you already know the answer is <span class="process-math">\(32^{\circ}\)</span>F, the given expression does not make it obvious. However, the given expression is equivalent to the following:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now the solution is more clear; if we substitute <span class="process-math">\(F=32\)</span> into the expression for <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{9}(32-32) = 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
