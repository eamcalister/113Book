<div class="para">Until now, our development has regarded a function as only slightly different than an algebraic expression. Algebraic expressions represent processes applied to their variables (the inputs), just like functions. The function concept blends this idea with solving equations by considering the evaluation result (the output) as a key piece; the output is a number that the function can equal for some input, which may be solved for. The graph of a function takes us a step further, so that we may see the totality of all inputs and outputs of the function as a single object, the graph of the function.</div>
