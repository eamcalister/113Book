<div class="para">Exponential functions are common in applications where the rate of change is not described in absolute terms, but in relative terms as a percent rate of change. For instance, suppose we say a population, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> is growing at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(50\%\)</span> per year with an initial value of <span class="process-math">\(1000\text{.}\)</span> This means that to find the population next year, we find the population of the current year, multiply it by <span class="process-math">\(0.5\text{,}\)</span> and add it to the current population. Then we can construct a table of values, with the input <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> being measured in years:</div>
