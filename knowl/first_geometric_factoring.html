<div class="para">The two expressions <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2\)</span> are not equivalent. One may detect this by noting the order in which operations are performed on <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> In one expression you add the two variables, then square. In the other, you square each variable, then add. Based one our experience with order of operations (order matters), we think these may not be equivalent. It turns out that if you pick any two numbers for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> as long as neither is zero, these two expressions will evaluate to different numbers. For instance, if we substitute <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=2\text{,}\)</span> then the first expression gives</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(1+2)^2 = 3^2 =9,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">whereas the second expression gives</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1^2+2^2 = 1+4 = 5.
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">It is also possible to see that these two expressions are inequivalent by giving the geometric representations. We begin by thinking of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as lengths. Then <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span> is the area of a square whose side length is <span class="process-math">\(x+y\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span> is the sum of areas of squares that fit inside the square of side length <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> as in the following diagram:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/image-10.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
