  "body": "Tips for Students  Types of Mathematical Understanding  For you, the student, I reiterate that this text (and class) should be different from what you may have encountered in prior mathematics, specifically Algebra, courses. Some of the specific differences will be explained below, but I want to explain the overarching one first:   This text was written with the intention that this will not be the last mathematics course you take. I assume you will take further courses (Calculus, Differential Equations, etc.) and gain all sorts of exotic mathematical skills. The goal now is for you to gain some deep understanding of symbolic algebra beyond a collection of procedures.   I highlighted the word \"understanding\" above for a reason. It turns out that there are two types of understanding in mathematics, described by Skemp in . They are as follows:     Relational Understanding: This is understanding at the level of knowing what to do, or how to arrive at an answer in a mathematical situation, and why.      Instrumental Understanding: This is understanding at the level of being able to apply rules without reasons to arrive at answers.    Let's consider an example of each in the context of multiplying fractions (this one is from Skemp's book). (Click on the example to show it and click on the solutions to diplay them, read them carefully. You'll want to do this through the remainder of the text.)    Perform the multiplication   Instrumental Version      Relational Version  Notice that is times . Then of that is because of is . Then we take of those to get .     In that example, which one is easier to perform and which one makes more sense? The first solution is probably easier, but that's not the same thing as making sense. If you were given a different rule to follow for multiplying fractions, you couldn't check that it was correct or incorrect without the second solution, which better utilizes an understanding of what multiplying and dividing really are.  \"I prefer to understand mathematics instrumentally.\" This is something students have said when presented with the above distinction. The problem is that as you move further in your study of mathematics, instrumental understanding will greatly limit you; you can only memorize so many procedures and keep them straight. Relational understanding is the understanding that mathematicians seek to cultivate by relating new mathematical ideas to old ones and examining the properties of new mathematical objects and consequences of new mathematical ideas.  Be aware, cultivating your own relational understanding of mathematics, specifically algebra, will not always be easy. Sometimes you'll find that applying procedures instrumentally is ok. For instance, you'll probably multiply fractions as in the first solution to the example problem; formally justufying that both solutions are equivalent is hard. However, you should always try to understand the \"whys\" of the math you're doing. Keep a growth mindset, and start your homework early, and you'll get it.   Text Specifics  This text is meant for you to read the whole thing and answer all the questions in it. Make sure that you always know which section you are supposed to be in and read it both before and after the class period in which it is covered. The sections aren't usually very long. In each one, you will encounter some of the following things:     Examples: Click on these and read through them carefully. Each one has a problem statement, which should be understood well before clicking on the solution. When you read the solution, do so with a pencil and paper to make sure you can fill in any missing steps.     Checkpoints: Checkpoints are online exercises that you can do to help make sure you're following what is being done. Click on the \"Activate\" button to make them interactive. These problems will often be in your Webwork homework assignments.     Questions: These are questions that often have essay type answers. They are often difficult questions that are meant to be thought provoking and\/or start a conversation with your instructor or a tutor. These might be collected by your instructor so that they can give informative feedback on your though processes. They will also help your instructor know where you may be having difficulty and address those areas.     "

  "title": "Tips for Teachers",
  "body": " Tips for Teachers  First, please read the guide for students. The first paragraph is meant for faculty as much as students.  The Ideas Behind the Text  This text is written for a first-year college audience who will be going on to take a Precalculus (with trigonometry) course followed by the Calculus sequence (mostly STEM majors). This will not be the first exposure to Algebra for most of the students, but it might be for some of them. It is not intended to be a terminal mathematics course. It is assumed that subsequent courses will expose students to the idea of functions as the primary object of study. In this course our goal is for students to gain literacy with symbols in mathematics. However, we don't just mean the ability to follow rules to get correct answers. We mean for students to attach concrete (possibly geometric) meaning to the symbols they write and understand mathematical operations as real actions .  How do we help our students both build the ability to make meaning, while also making sure they obtain manipulative fluency? The approach of this text is to blend the so-called three worlds of mathematics as described by David Tall in (his descriptions in italics):     Conceptual Embodiment builds on human perceptions and actions developing mental images that are verbalized in increasingly sophisiticated ways and become perfect mental entities in our imaginations.   In this text, this approach to mathematics often takes form in geometric understanding. For instance, we think of the variable as a length and manipulate geometric objects to make algebraic manipulations more concrete. For instance, we do this in and to give extra meaning to things most students have previously encountered.  It is the belief of this author that as mathematical ideas are understood, they all become somehow embodied.     Operational symbolism grows out of physical actions into mathematical procedures. Whereas some learners may remain at the proceduaral level, others may concieve the symbols flexibly as operations to perform and also to be operated on through calculation and manipulation.   It is often the case in Algebra courses that we jump straight to symbolism, and then are satisfied with students only gaining procedural competence. This is the \"rules without reason\" type of learing described in . By making sure we only proceed when students understand the meaning of the symbols we can have students work with them more flexibly.     Axiomatic formalism builds formal knowledge in axiomatic systems specified by set-theoretic definitions, whose properties are deduced my mathematical proof.   It may appear that formalism is limited in an introductory algebra course. This isn't really true. Indeed, many of the things students have the most difficulty with are due to formality that is unexplained.    These three worlds of mathematics exist and feed off one-another in simple places. For instance, exponents are something many students continually have trouble with. We can briefly describe how they fall into each world:   \"Exponents represent repeated multiplication.\" This is very much embodied for students who are comfortable with mutliplication of numbers. This embodied form is limited to positive exponents only.    Exponent properties listed in . These are symbolic properties derived from our embodied understanding of positive exponents. Memorizing the properties without regular reference to embodied examples regularly leads to incorrect properties.    Negative, zero, and fractional exponents are formally derived from the properties of positive exponents. Letting students know this (in more informal language) can let them know that this is difficult and may need more attention.     It is worthwhile to note as you teach from this text whether you are teaching something from an embodied, symbolic, or formal viewpoint. If you make a sudden swithch, make some sort of distinction of it for your students. As teachers of mathematics, we often move subconsciously between these three worlds. This can be jarring for students. If something is initially described in a way that is meant to be intuitive, but then moves to formal, students may think they missed something and are \"just not a math person\".   Text Specifics (for Faculty)  This text is meant for students to read and answer all the questions in it. Be sure to let students know where you are and what they should be reading. There are two exercise types in the text that are meant as breakpoints in the exposition.     Checkpoints: Checkpoints are online exercises that you can do to help make sure everyone following what is being done. They are Webwork problems that are mostly included in set definition files for the course (available on request). Working through some of them in class will help students gain confidence without having the class bog down into a sequence of sample homework problems.     Questions: These are questions that often have essay type answers. They are often difficult questions that are meant to be thought provoking and\/or start a conversation with your instructor or a tutor. They are meant as formative assessment. Some subset of these should be collected and graded (perhaps with a generous rubric) weekly.     "

  "body": " Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication     Visualize real numbers as positions on the line with zero and one as basic objects.    Understand and visualize addition, subtraction, and multiplication as geometric actions.    Introduce the notion of an inverse operation as the undoing of a given operation.     Operations on Numbers as Actions  Algebra is ultimately about applying some procedure, or sequence of procedures, to numbers, and asking which numbers yield some desired result. To this end, we need to conceptualize numbers more dynamically than just as a way of counting objects. In the following table we present a way to conceptualize numbers as positions on a line, and the basic operations as movements.   Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication as Motions on the Line    Positions and Sizes    Numbers    Location on a Line     Number            Center of the Line                  Basic Unit to the Right of Center     1            Position to the Right of Center     Positive Number            Position to the Left of Center     Negative Number             Given a position , the position that is the same distance from the center  but on the opposite side of the center                    Starting from , and moving the same distance and direction  that is from the center                    Starting from , and moving the same distance but opposite direction that is from the center                    When and are positive, the number whose size relative to is the same as the size of relative to                    is to the right of                    is to the left of                    In order to understand what's going on here, it will be useful to draw pictures. This is a picture of the real number line that you've probably seen before:   The basic number line.      This picture does not show us much, so let's show one with some generic numbers and , where both and are positive with .   A number line with two positive numbers labeled.          The point that represents 10 more than 78 is colored   red    blue    green    yellow     Solution  so we want the point at 88. There are 5 marked points between  each multiple of 10, so the little lines are 2 units apart. Thus we need the point  4 lines past 80 which is colored red.           Choose the graph showing on the number line. If no scale is given assume tick marks are one unit apart.  A.   B.   C.   D.     A    B    C    D          The correct answer is C.          Addition and Subtraction  To represent and geometrically, we first measure out the distance is to the right of zero, then move that far to the right of for and move that distance to the left of for .   Addition and subtraction of positive numbers.      In Figure , since we end up to the left of zero when we subtract from . This should make sense; if you take away more than you started out with, you end up with a shortage.     The following represents an equation that uses integers. Create an appropriate equation that represents the blue arrow.                                 With and in the same positions as in Figure , draw . What do you notice about in relation to ?      Now draw . Is the same relationship true for and ?        Draw a number line with numbers and on it, but this time make positive and negative. Is to the right or left of ? Explain.      Explain why for any number .    One of the important ideas in algebra is that of inverse operations . That is, two operations\/actions that, when performed in succession on a number or variable, result in the original number or variable being unchanged. We can see this idea by looking at subtraction. Observe that if and are numbers, then . This may seem obvious, especially if you draw it on the number line. However, the concept is very important; the inverse of adding to is subtracting . We may say that subtracting undoes addition or that when you add and subtract the same quantity they cancel each other .     Multiplication as Motion and Repeated Addition  Multiplication of real numbers is more difficult to visualize geometrically than addition or subtraction. The fundamental idea is that of stretching, with being a basic unit of measurement. Let's start with being any positive number and . We see that fits into exactly times. Since must have the same size relative to as does to , must fit into exactly times. Think of this as stretching by a factor of when .   The same number of copies of are in as copies of are in .      One good way to think of multiplying by numbers less than one is by thinking of percents less than .     Change the following percentages into decimals:                               To change a percentage to a decimal, we move the decimal to the left twice.            If is smaller than , for example , then you don't get a whole copy of in , you only have of one. This means you will only get of a copy of in . In the case when , we think of as a squeeze of by a factor of .  An important case happens when one of the two numbers is a whole number (an integer). If is a positive integer, then fits into exactly times. Hence, if is positive, will fit into exactly times. Let's view this on the number line with :  Multiplication of by . Compare with adding to itself times.       The key observation here is that when you add to itself times you get the same result as when you multiply by . In other words, multiplication by a positive integer represents repeated addition. This is where the terminology times comes from; we’re taking and adding it to itself times.   Note that this gives us two different ways of thinking of multiplication; it represents repeated addition when the multiplier is positive and whole, but represents stretching or compression in other cases. We use the mental representation that makes the most sense for a given problem. This may seem confusing at first, but being aware of having several representations of mathematical objects, and knowing when you use them, is a key skill in truly understanding mathematics.    Explain why and for any number .      If is a number between and , what is the possible range of values for      ?      ?      ? Note: Only is multiplied by , the is not multiplied by .        Explain why is equal to when and are both positive integers.    This question is pretty difficult. Giving a really good answer should start by thinking of as the number of objects when you take piles of size , since that is one way of visualizing added to itself times. Then describe how you could systematically rearrange those objects into piles of size .   Lastly, let's think about multiplying with negative numbers. Recall from Table that if is a number, then is the same distance from , but on the other side of from . Multiplying negative numbers extends this idea. When is any number and is a negative number, then is the number with the same squeeze or stretch factor applied to as if were positive, but flipped to the other side of zero. For instance if is positive, then is the number as far from as , flipped to the other side of from .  Multiplying by a negative is multiplying by a positive, then flipping across zero.         Explain why the following statements are true using pictures and words to represent the numbers involved:      A positive number times a positive number is positive.      A positive number times a negative number is negative.      A negative number times a negative number is positive.      If is any number, multiplying by results in .       "

Work with units of measurement via multiplying and dividing fractions.    Understand addition of fractions from the viewpoint of units of measurement.      Division and Multiplication  We begin with the most basic way to conceptualize fractions using positions on the number line.

Since this table assumes is a positive integer so that we may use the idea of multiplication as repeated addition to reach a more formal understanding of division.   Multiplication and Division as Inverse Operations of One Another  Since taking steps of size reaches , we have the following identity: When and are not integers, we use this identity to what is: For any numbers and , is the unique number such that when it is multiplied by , the result is . In other words, multiplication by is the inverse operation of dividing by . Likewise, division is the inverse operation of multiplication.    You may notice that uses much more formal language than we have so far in this text. This is because the formal language is the only way to capture the range of all posibilities (non-integer numbers, negative numbers etc.); our intuitive ideas only work with positive integers. Moving from geometric or numerical intuition to more formal mathematics is often difficult and it is best to make sure we know when this is being done. To get a little practice with using the formal definition of a fraction, let's try to answer a seemingly simple question: Why is   To answer this we will explain why the left-hand side of this equation has the property, given in , that when it is multiplied by the result is . First, notice that (Observe that we are using , which we will justify intuitively in Chapter 2.) Since and , we have shown the left-hand side has the property we wanted it to have.     Explain why . (This is why you can cancel common factors in numerators and denominators.)      Fundamental Fraction Properties:   There are four fundamental properties that we must internalize about fraction in order to do arithmetic with them:                             What do you get when you multiply by ?      What do you get when you multiply by ?      Explain why .        (Multiplying Fractions) Explain why using the fundamental fraction properties.       Enter the following rational numbers from least to greatest.  Separate your answers by commas. No decimals or mixed fractions.  , , ,   Remember, to enter a fraction of the form , type a \/ b.   is the starting point since it is the smallest. Continue in increasing order and don't forget to put commas between the numbers.             We can also use the stretch\/squeeze metaphor of multiplication to give a geometric interpretation of when is not an integer. To do this, let's let , and assume and are still positive (since negatives just reflect to the other side of zero). Our goal is to figure out where is on the number line. To do this, we first do a manipulation: This manipulation used the fact that multiplication by undoes division by . From this manipulated equation we see that is the number that when stretched (if ) or squeezed (if ) by gives you .    Explain the following two statements. Hint: Use the fact that multiplying by must undo whatever action multiplying by does.      If is very large, then is very small.      If is very close to zero, but still positive, then is very large.      Now let's consider why we must say is undefined no matter what is.     Reason 1: Consider the fraction where is positive. We know that if is very close to zero, then will be very large. For example, because if you squeeze by a factor of you get . However, you can always make the smaller and get a bigger number. This means that would need to be larger than every positive number. But no such number exists, so must be undefined.     Reason 2: The expression should represent the number that when multiplied by results in . However, any number multiplied by zero must be zero. For this reason, if is not zero, then cannot equal . Thus we say that cannot represent a number if .    To really see why the expression is undefined, you need an idea from Calculus, but you can get a feel for why it must be undefined in the next question.    Give a short reason why the expression could represent either or .      Apples and Oranges: Units and Dimensional Analysis  So far we have only talked about multiplying and dividing fractions. These operations with fractions are fundamentally easier then addition and subtraction. In order to build a useful metaphor of how to add and subtract fractions, it will be useful to talk about units of measurement. Not only will understanding units and unit conversion be useful for understanding fractions, but it is extremely useful in the sciences.   Dimensional Analysis and the Factor-Label Method of Unit Conversion  A very common task in physics or chemistry classes involves converting between units of measurement of quantities of the same dimension. The simplest way to do this is to treat the units of measurement as numbers multiplied by the numerical quantity in those units. So if we say a rod is two meters long, we would write the mathematical expression where is the abbreviation for meters multiplied by the number . Since the unit name (the label) is multiplied by a number it is a factor in that expression. This is why we call this treatment of unit names as numbers the factor-label method . By treating the units as number, we can use our prior knowledge of arithmetic operations to make conversions.   Convert ounces into milliliters.  This is a legal conversion because both ounces and milliliters have the same dimension; both units describe volume. In order to make the conversion, we write down an equation with the number of one of the units in another: Form this equation, we can divide to obtain without units in two different ways: Multiplying the quantity by either of these expressions for must leave it unchanged. In order to obtain final units of , we will multiply by the second because (we say the units of ounces cancel).     A is a unit of length equal to 20ft (it isn't used much anymore). Suppose an old city plan shows that the street is wide with a sidewalk that is yd on each side. What is the total width of the street plus both sidewalks? You may be able to see quickly that the answer is 52ft, but let's do all the conversions carefully.  You may be able to see quickly that the answer is 52ft, but let's do all the conversions carefully. First, note that we will need to add the width of both sidewalks to the width of the street. It isn't convenient to convert ropes to yards or yards to ropes; it makes the most sense to convert everything to feet. Let's write all our conversion equations: So we get the following:      Suppose a person is on a train that is moving km\/hr and they run from the rear of the train to the front at a rate of m\/s. How fast is this person moving relative to the ground in m\/s? Note that km = m and hr = s.     The factor-label method of dimensional analysis can also be used to change the way we look at a changing quantity through multiplication and division. For instance, suppose a tank contains a salt water solution with a concentration of grams of salt per liter. If the tank is drained at a rate of mL\/s, at what rate is salt leaving the tank in g\/s?  To solve this problem, let’s first convert the draining rate into L\/s: Now we just need to multiply quantities to arrive at the correct units for the rate of salt leaving the tank:      The cost of fuel for a riverboat is per hour when moving miles per hour. In addition to fuel costs, the operating cost (paying the crew etc.) is per hour. What is the total cost in \/mi when the boat is moving miles per hour?       Adding and Subtracting Fractions  Now that we have thought about real world units of measurement, and we can convert units that measure the same dimensional quantity, we can introduce a useful metaphor for adding, subtracting, and comparing fractions:  Denominators and Units    Units of Measurement   Numbers         Dimensional Unit of -ths       Often it will be best to think of fractions as units of length (like when we think of numbers as positions on a line), but they could be areas, volumes, etc. Here we will think of the number as the basic unit of measurement. Then a -th is the unit that goes into the basic unit times. For instance, if we are thinking of as foot, then is one inch because there are 12 inches in one foot.    For each of the following basic units, what fraction does the given quantity represent? For instance, if the basic unit is one yard, then foot is because there are three feet in a yard. If you need to look up some unit conversions, Google them.     Basic Unit: 1 kilometer. meters .      Basic Unit: 1 cup. ounce .      Basic Unit: 1 meter. centimeters .      Basic Unit: 1 gallon. quarts .      Basic Unit: 1 football field. yards .      Basic Unit: 1 tablespoon. teaspoons .      Thinking of the denominator in terms of units, where a larger denominator represents a smaller unit, may help in comparing fractions, as in the following Checkpoint.     Enter the following rational numbers from least to greatest.  Separate your answers by commas. No decimals or mixed fractions.  , , ,   Remember, to enter a fraction of the form , type a \/ b.   is the starting point since it is the smallest. Continue in increasing order and don't forget to put commas between the numbers.             Now let's revisit the example of ropes and yards from the last section. In order to add two ropes to four yards, it was necessary to convert both ropes and yards into a smaller unit that went into both ropes and yards evenly. Specifically, both were converted to feet to get a total of 52 feet. When we are just working with numbers we do something very similar; we find a common denominator.   Add to .  To get started we can look at it pictorially with and on number lines:      If we divide in half and into five pieces, we find that goes into both and evenly.       Now we see the addition: This is the geometric way of visualizing the process known as known as cross multiplying . That is when you multiply each part of a fraction with a fraction equal to one in order to have a common denominator:     One thing we usually try to find is the least common denominator between two fractions. Thinking in terms of units, this is like finding the largest possible unit that goes into both quantities evenly. In the example given above we could have used to go into and evenly and obtained However, that makes the numbers we are dealing with larger for no reason. This would be like converting both ropes and yards into inches; it's possible, but unnecessary.    Draw a picture to carefully perform the following:                       Perform the indicated additions and subtractions. Leave your answers with the smallest possible denominators.                                          "

Develop fundamental properties of exponents through examples.    Develop the definition of zero, negative, and fractional exponents formally as consequences of fundamental exponent properties.     Most fundamentally, exponents represent repeated multiplication in the way that multiplication represents repeated addition.  Exponents and Multiplication as Repeated Operations    Multiplication as Repeated Addition   Exponents as Repeated Multiplication          Historical Note  The first use of superscripts for exponents was by René Descartes in the 1637 text La Geométrie  . Prior to this, all sorts of notations were used to describe repeated multiplication. For instance, Vieté would write \" Cubus\" for , as he insisted represented the volume of a cube.   Based on this idea, we can see the following properties of exponents:  exponent properties   Properties of Exponents:      . For example:  .    If , . For example:  .     . For example:  .     . For example:   .     . For example:  .     We can use these properties to re-write expressions with exponents in alternate forms. When we do this, it is helpful to do the following to solidify you understanding:   Take it one step at a time and write down which exponent property you're using at each step.    If the exponents are positive whole numbers, try to write the expression out without exponents as an intermediate step, as in the \"for example\" lines in .      Suppose we are given the instruction to write the expression with a single exponent and base . In other words, we want to find the expression for in the equation .  To do this, we'll use the exponent properties. Thus, our expression for is .  To check whether this really makes sense, let and . Then we can work it out without explicitly using any exponent properties to get the same answer. Observing that , we're seeing the same answer as we got with exponent properties. Here we strictly used the definition of exponents.   Here are a some exercises for you to practice.     Rewrite the following using a single exponent.  for =                Write the following expression in the form , assuming . Simplify your answer as much as possible.  =                Rewrite the following as a perfect square.                More subtlety arises when making sense out of zero, negative, and fractional exponents. The problem is that we don't know what it means to multiply a number by itself zero times, a negative number of times, or a fractional number of times. Because of this, we use the properties listed above to define zero, negative, and fractional exponents.  First, let's consider what should equal, where is a nonzero number. We know that if is any number that . Using the second exponent property given above, we have Since , we define whenever is not zero ( is undefined).  Now consider a negative exponent, . Here we use the first two exponent properties to arrive at what must be. We have Shortening this string of equalities, we have . Now we divide both sides by to get . In words, a negative exponent indicates division by the same number with a positive exponent.     Simplify the following. Write numerical answers as fractions multiplied out and write expressions containing variables using positive exponents only.

  "body": " Parentheses and Order of Operations     Learn why correct order of operations is important.    Learn to read mathematical expressions in the order indicated by order of operations.    Become aware of invisible parentheses       The Basic Order of Operations  Each of the previous sections in this chapter have focused mostly on one mathematical operation at a time. However, it is often the case that more than one operation is performed. Difficulty arises because the order in which operations occur matters; different orders yield different results. For example, let's consider the two mathematical processes described below:    Take the number two, add three to it, then multiply the result by four.    Take the number two, multiply it by four, then add three to the result.    The two operations are adding three and multiplying by four, but performed in different orders. In the first order, two gets shifted up to five, then stretched out by a factor of four, yielding an end result of 20. In the second, two gets stretched out to eight, then that is shifted up by three, yielding an end result of 11. In order to distinguish these two orders using mathematical notation, we use parentheses to enclose those procedures that are to be performed first. Specifically, we have the following symbolic representations corresponding to the verbal descriptions given above:              In a mathematical expression, any procedures that are enclosed in parentheses are meant to be performed before those procedures outside that set of parentheses. One way to think of parentheses is that whatever is inside them must be combined\/simplified to a single quantity before proceeding.  What about the other operations? You probably have learned the answer earlier in your mathematical lives. Indeed, in the last section we used parentheses in expressions with exponents without really explaining their use. You may have even encountered some mnemonic device for remembering order of operations. Because being able to execute the operations is more important than just remembering, we will catalog the order of operations rules here, then use them in some problems.    Order of Operations order of operations     Procedures enclosed in parentheses should be performed before any operations outside those parentheses.    Exponents should be applied second, but only to the object that the exponent is directly above and to the right of.    Multiplication and\/or division should be performed before addition and\/or subtraction unless otherwise indicated by parentheses. In other words, in an expression only involving addition and multiplication, those individual multiplications are in parentheses.    Division is just multiplication by the reciprocal, so division and multiplication can be performed in either order.    Subtraction is just addition of a negative, so subtraction and addition can be performed in either order.     These aren't actually too hard to keep track of, just as long as you remember that their purpose is to remove ambiguity from mathematical notation. For instance, without these rules could be interpreted either as or . These rules make sure that we all agree that it is .  In addition to multiplications having understood (but not written down) parentheses around them, there are often understood parentheses in fractions. For instance, if we write we will understand that is to be performed first. Usually this isn't an issue when fractions are written with horizontal lines, but we would have to use parentheses to write it on a single line as .    Evaluate each of the following quantities without a calculator. If your answer is a fraction, give it in reduced form.                                                           Verbally describe the sequence of operations performed on the number in the correct order. (Part (1) has been done as an example.)         First, is added to . The result is then multiplied by .                       Implied (``Invisible'') Parentheses  There are some mathematical operations that are common enough to have implied parentheses implied parentheses . That is, even though we don't write down parentheses in an expression, we mean for some operation to be done before another one. The common ones are as follows:  Fraction Bars: A fraction written with a horizontal division bar has an implied set of parentheses on the numerator and denominator. So if a fraction has in the numerator and in the denominator, we have For example,   Radicals: Expressions under radicals (roots) are to be done before the root is taken. For example,   Exponents: Expressions that appear in the exponent of a single number are evaluated before the power is taken. For example,      Simplify the following expressions:          Now we come to the end of our chapter on arithmetic with numbers. Those of you with some exposure to algebra may now say, This is easy, but algebra is very different and difficult. The truth is that is we keep the representations of arithmetic operations from this chapter in mind, algebra will not be that difficult.   "

Practice breaking down algebraic expressions into simple steps in the correct order.     An algebraic expression algebraic expression is a mathematical expression formed using the normal operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents for now) and one or more variables (unknown quantities for which we may substitute numbers). Let's look at some basic algebraic expressions, describe them verbally, and evaluate them for some values of the variables.   Consider the algebraic expression This expression only contains one variable, . We can substitute values for and get values of the algebraic expression. Exaluate this expression when and . Then describe what the expression does to in the correct order.  If we evaluate this expression at we get If we evaluate this expression at we have Evaluating algebraic expressions isn't that hard provided you keep track of your order of operations. An important related skill is to read an algebraic expression and verbally express what is being done to the variable(s) in the correct order. In this expression we start with the value of and  Step 1:  multiply by three, (We'll label this S1 for Step One and continue labeling steps this way.)   S2:  add one to the result of S1    S3:  square the result of S2 , and finally   S4:  subtract two from the result of S3 .        This idea of verbally describing algebraic expressions and understanding the steps that they represent is important for seeing algebraic expressions as something other than just a bunch of random symbols on a page. This task will become very powerful when solving equations and continue to be useful well into the study of Calculus (and beyond).   Algebraic Expressions Describe Processes Performed on Variables  An algebraic expression a symbolic representation of a sequence of arithmetic operations performed in a specific order on general numbers (variables).     Write an algebraic expression that represents the following process applied to :    S1:  Add one to ,   S2:  square the result of S1    S3:  subtract two from the result of S2 , and finally   S4:  multiply the result of S3 by .     Evaluate the expression you get at , , and .    We will often abbreviate the result of a step Sn by just writing Sn . For example, we could just write \"multiply S3 by \" for the last step above.  (Try to) Make the Steps Undoable  Eventually, our goal will be to solve equations invovling algebraic expressions. We will see that this often involves taking steps and undoing them in the correct (reverse) order. Sometimes this will mean we need to take some extra special care with out language for steps.  Take as an example the expression . This seems like a one-step expression described as Step: Divide by . This is an adequate description until we want to solve for in an equation (we'll do this in the next chapter). The problem with this description is that the action is being applied to and not . Thus, we cannot undo the action and get back to . Instead, we introduce the phrase \"take the reciprocal of\" to mean divide by some variable quantity. In this case, we would say   Step: Take the reciprocal of .   Undoing taking the reciprocal of a quantity is simple; you just take the reciprocal again (this is the \"flip\" operation with fractions, if you want another word).    Verbally describe the expression by placing the steps in the correct order.    Add to .    Take the reciprocal of the result of the previous step.    Multiply the result of the previous step by .    Think of as .   Sometimes a variable can appear more than once in an expression, which may make describing it as a single procedure more difficult. This difficulty is dealt with by thinking of a combination of procedures using order of operations.   Verbally describe the expression   If we were evaluating this at a specific value of , we would perform the addition of with last . For this reason, we take each part that will be added together and describe them separately first. For the first term (a term is a part of an algebraic expression being added to other parts):   S1:  Square , then   S2:  multiply S1 by four.    Then we pick up with the second term:   S3:  Add one to ,   S4:  take the square root of S3 , and   S5:  multiply S4 by two.    The last step is the last thing according to our order of operations:   S6: Add the result of S2 to the result of steps S5 .       List the steps being performed on , in order, for each of the following algebraic expressions:                               Let's finish this section with examples of algebraic expressions that you might come across in another class or the real world.   An algebraic expression commonly encountered in a first year physics course gives the height of a projectile, in meters, above the ground seconds after it has been launched. This expression has parameters for initial height and initial upward velocity. The expression is where is the initial upward velocity in m\/s and is the initial height in meters. For instance, if we knew the initial height was meters and the initial velocity was m\/s (if the object was dropped, not thrown), then we would have      Using the expression above, with and , for the height, answer the following questions to the best of your ability (you may need a calculator).      How high is the object after seconds? seconds?      When does the object hit the ground?      Is the object ever meters above the ground? Justify your answer in practical terms and algebraically, if possible.       The following table gives the men's world record times for running events as of Summer 2017, as well as the average speeds in m\/s.      Distance (m)   time (s)   speed (m\/s)    100  9.58  10.44    200  19.19  10.42    400  43.03  9.3    800  100.91  7.93    1500  206  7.28    5000  757.35  6.6     Using techniques from statistics or linear algebra (data fitting), it is possible to give an algebraic expression involving the distance that approximately tells you the record time . The expression one finds this way is Since speed is distance divided by time, we can then formulate an expression for the speed in terms of the distance :      Use the expressions in the last example to answer the following questions.      The expressions given above only give approximations. After all, if we could find record times with a formula we wouldn’t need to have races. Use a calculator to evaluate the expression given for , for each distance, and see how well it matches the data.      What does the expression for say the record time for meters should be? Is it accurate? (Use the internet to check.)      Two versions of the expression for are shown. Use the rules for fractions and exponents from Chapter 1 to explain why these two versions are really the same.      In the expression for , what happens to as gets very large (recall )? Does this make practical sense?      "

Prove that expressions are inequivalent through substitution.    Introduce the commutative, associative, and distributive laws of addition and multiplication (along with their geometric interpretations) as a means of creating equivalent expressions by reordering, regrouping, and factoring.      Examples of Equivalent Expressions  Two algebraic expressions are equivalent equivalent algebraic expressions if whenever particular values are substituted into both expressions, the end result is the same for both expressions.   Consider the algebraic expressions  Substitute several different values for to decide if you think these two expressions are equivalent.  Let's try first. Substituting into the first expression we have In the second expression we get Since we got the same result when , the expressions might be equivalent.  Now let's try . Substituting into the first expression we have In the second expression we get Again, the same result is obtained. You should try some of your own values of now; if you evaluate correctly, these two expressions should always give the same result.       Determine whether the expressions are equivalent or not.    and    and    and    and    and          Note that testing values isn't really enough to prove two expressions are equivalent. It just provides evidence. We'll prove these expressions are equivalent in .  Thinking of algebraic expressions procedurally, we have the following characterization of equivalent algebraic expressions:    Equivalent Expressions as Different Processes with the Same Result   Equivalent algebraic expressions are symbolic representations of different processes performed on the variables that always give the same end result.   People who are good at algebra often speak of manipulating\/simplifying algebraic expressions and putting expressions into different forms. What they are talking about is replacing an expression with an equivalent expression. The reason for manipulating expressions is that sometimes one version of an expression makes it easier to see a solution to a problem. For instance, the expression used to find the temperature in C given the temperature in F is where is the temperature in F and is the temperature in C. Suppose we want to know what temperature in F corresponds to C. Even if you already know the answer is F, the given expression does not make it obvious. However, the given expression is equivalent to the following: Now the solution is more clear; if we substitute into the expression for in terms of , we get .  Notice that these two expressions represent different procedures if we write them down sequentially. The first version ( ) obtains from by the following steps:  S1: Multiply by .  S2: Subtract from S1 .  The second version ( ) obtains from through a different sequence of steps:  S1 : Subtract from .  S2 : Multiply S1 by .  The procedures are different, so are these two expressions equivalent? The answer here comes from the arithmetic rule known as the distributive law (to be discussed more later ). We can take the second expression and distribute the as follows:   Another example of equivalent expressions is give by the Checkpoint . In this case, we used the fact that the expression is equivalent to .  Fundamentally, since algebraic expressions are built using the operations of arithmetic, equivalence of algebraic expressions is determined by using rules of arithmetic. We will discuss the most commonly used ways of manipulating expressions into equivalent ones in the remainder of this section. However, we will first discuss how to tell if two expressions are inequivalent.    Inequivalent Expressions  Two expressions are not equivalent if there are some values of the variables in the expression that yield different numbers when you substitute. So, if you plug the same number into two expressions and get different results, then the two expressions are inequivalent (assuming you did the arithmetic correctly). With practice, you'll get good at being able to detect inequivalent expressions without even needing to substitute anything. For now, we'll look at some important examples, that sometimes trip people up, and see them in a new (or maybe really old, see Historical Note) way.   The two expressions and are not equivalent. One may detect this by noting the order in which operations are performed on and . In one expression you add the two variables, then square. In the other, you square each variable, then add. Based one our experience with order of operations (order matters), we think these may not be equivalent. It turns out that if you pick any two numbers for and , as long as neither is zero, these two expressions will evaluate to different numbers. For instance, if we substitute and , then the first expression gives whereas the second expression gives   It is also possible to see that these two expressions are inequivalent by giving the geometric representations. We begin by thinking of and as lengths. Then is the area of a square whose side length is , while is the sum of areas of squares that fit inside the square of side length as in the following diagram:       In this figure we see that the total shaded area is while the area of the entire square is . If you note that the unshaded portions of the square each have area , we can see that is equivalent to (That can be seen symbollically using the distributive law , which we will see soon.).   Historical Note: The Original Algebra  The geometric representation of squares of numbers as actual squares is perhaps the most ancient form of algebra, dating back to ancient Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq). This geometric representation is also the basis of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's first text in algebra. The term \"algebra\" comes from the arabic Al-Jabr, which roughly translates to re-joining, as in putting together broken squares.     Explain why is not equivalent to . Do this both by plugging in numbers and by either referring to the last example, or using the Pythagorean Theorem to explain the inequivalence geometrically.      Use volumes to give a geometric explanation of why is equivalent to , but is not equivalent to . (This question may be a test of your artistic skills.)     is not equivalent to . A simple, but perhaps not helpful, reason is because that's not how you add fractions. Let's make sure we really see that this is not how you add fractions. First substitute . Then the first expression evaluates to while the second evaluates to Even if you forget how to add fractions you can tell these are not equal. The first one is larger than one and the second is smaller than one.   Again, it is important to note that for two expressions to be equivalent, they must evaluate to the same number for all values of the variables, not just some. For instance, in the example with squares, if the two expressions do evaluate to the same thing. However, this does not make the expressions equivalent.    Reordering and Regrouping  Sometimes the order in which operations are performed in an algebraic expression doesn't affect the result. Specifically, if the expression only involves addition, order of operations doesn't tell you which one to do first because it doesn't matter. Likewise for multiplication. Specifically, we have the following rules for addition and multiplication:   Commutative and Associative Laws for Addition and Multiplication  For any numbers , , and     (addition is commutative)     (multiplication is commutative)     (addition is associative)     (multiplication is associative)    To emphasize that these properties of arithmetic make sense, we can find geometric ways of understanding them, similar to what we did in Chapter 1.  In Chapter 1 you were asked to explain the commutativity of addition geometrically using lengths on the number line ( ). Explain the commutativity of multiplication, by thinking of and as lengths of the sides of a rectangle similar to the way we thought of and in .  Using the fact that the area of a rectangle is given by we can arrange our rectangle with on the bottom and on the side to get the area to be . If we simply rotate the rectangle degrees, the are is then seen as . Since rotation doesn't change the area, we must have .  These rectangles have the same area, so          Now we would like geometric explanations of the associative laws.      Explain the associative law for addition using lengths on the number line.      Explain the associative law for multiplication using the fact that the volume of a rectangular prism is the area of its base multiplied by its height (similar to our explanation of the commutative law for multiplication).      These rules are most useful in simplifying complex expressions that involve many terms being added together or multiplied.  To prove that are equivalent, the easiest way is to begin and turn it into the other expression by first getting a common denominator and using the disributive law:      Determine whether the equations are identities.                       Suppose you have two cans, both are inches tall, but one has a diameter that is three times that of the other one. Let denote the diameter of the smaller can, in inches. Find a simplified expression for the total volume of the two cans in terms of .  First we note the formula for the volume of a cylinder: , where is the radius and is the height. Since both cans have a height of inches, we substitute . Since , the volume of the first can is then given by . Using associativity and commutativity, this simplifies to Since the diameter of the larger can is three times that of the smaller can, its radius is , which makes its volume Adding them together we have    In the last step of the previous example we performed an important type of regrouping known as combining like terms . This is when all the terms with the same algebraic type (same exponents on a variable for example) are combined into a single term by adding together the constants by which they are multiplied. It is important to note that terms can only be combined when the only difference between them is a constant multiplier. For instance, The remaining terms cannot be combined further because one has an exponent of while the other has an exponent of .  Let's see another reason unlike terms can't be combined. Consider the expression . To make it more meaningful, we may think of as a length with units of meters. Then represents a volume in cubic meters. Because of dimensional considerations, and cannot be combined in a meaningful way. In order for this expression to make any practical sense when is in meters, the needs to be in square meters. However, then the is dimensionless, while the represents an area. We cannot add the and the , since they represent different units. So thinking of as representing some geometric quantity shows that it cannot be simplified any further.    Give a collection of objects (geometric shapes, not necessarily real-world objects) that would have a volume represented by ?      Decide if the following attempts to combine like terms are correct. If a mistake was made, say what it was and correct it.                  Distributing, Expanding, and Factoring  One of the most important rules in constructing equivalent algebraic expressions is the Distributive Law.   The Distributive Law  For any numbers , , and    This fact asserts that you can    add two lengths, and , on the line together, then expand\/compress by a factor of , or    expand\/contract each of and by a factor of , then add the results together.    The end result is the same in either case because the stretch\/compression caused by multiplication by is uniformly applied to all lengths. We can also see this in terms of areas like we did with other properties of the real numbers that involve multiplication (like again). In the equation We can think of and as horizontal lengths and as a vertical length as in the diagram below:  The right-hand side of the distributive law represents the sum of the areas of two separate recatngles, one is amd the other is .       When we glue these two recangles together, we have one rectangle whose area is Since gluing didn't change the total area, we have   The left-hand side of the distributive law represents the area of one rectangle obtained by gluing the previous two together.       Many seemingly complex algebraic manipulations boil down to using the distributive law several times and collecting like terms; it's just that , , and may be some sort of algebraic expressions.   Find the expanded form of using the distributive law.        Describe what each term in the second and third lines of the manipulation given above represents geometrically as areas, as in the example in the last section showing . Hint: Go back and look at again.     Simplify the expression by combining like terms.   Subtraction of quantities in parentheses is often simplified using the distributive law and remembering that subtraction is really just addition of times the given quantity. For instance, suppose we want to simplify the expression First, re-write it with addition and multiplying the piece in parentheses, then apply the distributive law: With practice, you probably won't need to write this many steps down. This process is often referred to as distributing a minus sign .    Now is probably a good time to just get a little practice expanding\/distributing and collecting like terms. Just remember the distributive law and you'll see it's not that hard.    Expand (write as an equivalent expression without parentheses) each of the following expressions and collect like terms:                          Now we will go backward from expanding\/distributing. This process is known as factoring. When we expand an expression, we write it as an equivalent expression that is a sum of simple terms that each only involve multiplication and\/or division. To factor an expression means to write it as a product of simple terms. For example, earlier in this chapter we had two expressions for the temperature in C in terms of the temperature in F. The expression is in expanded form, while is in factored form. Factored forms of expressions are often useful for solving equations as we'll see in the next chapter. Factoring isn't something that can be done in all cases by a single procedure; the following are just a few examples of common factoring methods.   When each term of an expression is divisible by some common factor one can un-distribute that factor. For instance, if we are given the expression we can see that each term contains and as a factor. This means we can factor out of the expression to get the equivalent expression Note that you can check your answer by applying the distributive law. An interpretation of pulling out a common factor like this is that each term is being stretched\/compressed by the same amount, hence we can think of this as a single entity being stretched\/compressed, which may be simpler.    Expressions of the form , where , , and are constants are known as quadratic expressions in the variable . Factoring such expressions is a very common and useful algebraic task. It is possible to give a procedure for factoring quadratics, but right now it is best to proceed with examples and practice. For instance, consider the expression We wish to re-write this expression in the form for some numbers , , , and . (We present two solutions, which you may use based on your own preferences.)  (Trial and Error Method) First, let's expand : We note that    must equal ,     must equal , and     must equal .    Now you can do a little trial and error to find your solution (This is a very common thing to do in mathematics.)   Attempt 1: The term must equal . So let's try and . From the fact that must equal we can try and . However, then we find So that combination won't work. With that combination of and we will find that and will always fail (note how the and must line up because and have opposite signs). So we move on to another try.  Attempt 2: The term must equal . So let's try and . Again, we know that must equal we can try and . However, then we find Notice that works out. Hence we can say     (The Method, with explanation) We begin the same way, by expanding : Now we make some clever observations:  The product of the two terms in is equal to the product of the first and last coefficients. that is,   Since must equal and must equal we must be able to break into a sum of two numbers that multiply to .    Noting that , we have     The second solution is the so-called method including the reasoning behind it. Applying it blindly isn't terribly insightful in terms of explaining what factoring really does, but it gets the answer. For this reason it is recorded below:   The Method  To factor :   Multiply .    Think of numbers that multiply to . Look for a pair that adds to . If you cannot find one, this quadratic can't be factored with whole numbers.    If you get numbers that multiply to and add , replace with an explicit sum, and distribute . With the four terms you have at this point, use factoring by un-distributing one thing at a time (this is called factoring by grouping ). You are guaranteed to find a factorization.        Example 2.25 . Any expression of the form may be factored as ( and may represent more complicated expressions in this). One may check this using the distributive law. To see how this factorization works geometrically, consider the following figure with being thought of as a number smaller than .       In this figure the entire square has an area of units and the gray shaded area has an area of units. Each of the smaller shaded rectangles has area and the lower right shaded square has an area of . Hence the total shaded area is Now each term has a common factor of , hence we may factor it off and simplify by collecting like terms:   One may also see this factorization geometrically by taking the shaded rectangle on top and moving it to the left hand side of the diagram.       Now we have a single shaded rectangle whose height is and whose width is , hence the total area is .       Factor completely:                  Factor completely:                  Factor completely:      No correct answer specified           Factor:      No correct answer specified          Think of , , and as positive lengths to use areas of rectangles to explain why     "

  "body": " Equations and their Solutions     Introduce algebraic equations and the basic idea of solving them.    Solve equations through algebraic manipulations including factoring and clearing denominators.      algebraic equation   An algebraic equation is two algebraic expression separated by an equals sign.    Recall that we may think of an algebraic expression as a symbolic representation of some sequence of operations performed on the variable(s). Thus, an algebraic equation indicates that two different processes carried out on the same variable(s) result in the same output. Clearly, different processes typically lead to different results, so solutions (values of the variable for which both processes yield the same result) to equations are interesting. In our study of algebra, the most fruitful way of thinking of an equation is as a question.    Algebraic Equations as Questions   Algebraic Equation as a Question   An algebraic equation should be thought of as the following question: What values of the variable(s) give the same results when the processes on the right and left are performed?     Consider the equation Find as many solutions as you can, and at least one non-solution.  The left-hand side of the equation multiplies by itself. The right-hand side adds to itself. The equation is asking what values of give same result if you apply these two processes. Upon a little reflection we see that and will work. We may check by substituting these values into the equation and seeing if the resulting numerical equation is true. For we have which simplifies to (that's true). If we substitute we have which is also true. On the other hand, if we substitute the resulting numerical equation is Since , is not a solution to this equation.   Since there are infinitely many numbers to check, and equations may be complicated, it would be impossible to proceed by just guessing and checking to find solutions. Thus we want a (sort of) systematic approach to solving equations. We also see from the example above that equations may have multiple solutions, so we also want to know if we have found all of the solutions. Usually this gets answered on a case by case basis. We will look at some important examples in this chapter.      Find an equation with and as its only solutions. Hint: What is a procedure you can do to and and get the same result?      For any number , can you find an equation with and as its only solutions?         Basic Solving  For now, we will consider equations that only involve one variable. Our goal is to find all values of the variable that make the equation true. We ultimately want to get a statement that looks like Let's consider a relatively easy example.   Solve the equation   We don't need to do any steps to get all the 's on one side, since they are already there; all we need to do is undo the operations on the left. The expression means to do the following:   S1: Multiply by .  S2: add to S1 .  S3: take the square root of S2 .    We can solve the equation by systematically undoing each of these steps, starting with S3 . So we do the following:  Undo S3: square both sides to get   Undo S2: subtract to get   Undo S1: divide by to get     (Now you should substitute into the original equation to check that it is a solution.)  This process of solving by undoing operations in order might be called the \"shoes and socks\" method. You can think of each step in the algebraic expression on the left-hand side of the equation as an article of clothing, like shoes and socks. You can remove them (undo the operation), but you have to do it in reverse order (first remove the shoes, then the socks).    Notice that after each step in solving an equation you are left with another equation. We hope that the new equation will be easier to solve after each step. The critical thing is that each new equation must be equivalent to the previous one in the sense that it has the same solutions. The manipulations that one can do to equations that result in equivalent equations are as follows:     Replace an algebraic expression with an equivalent algebraic expression. This usually takes the form of simplifying the expression one side of the equation in order to make solving easier.    Apply an operation to both sides of the equation. This is what you do when you    apply the same operation to both sides of an equation, and    undo operations in order to solve for the variable.      Often, when we apply the same operation to both sides of an equation, this takes the form of moving from one side to the other . What is really happening is undoing an operation on one side and applying the same inverse operation on the other.  To eliminate confusion, each time we write down an equivalent equation from a given equation, we will use the symbol or to separate them. Interpret this symbol as meaning this equation is true exactly when that equation is true .     (a) What operation on both sides of the equation isolates the variable on one side? There may be more than one correct answer.   Taking the cube root of both sides    Dividing both sides by    Dividing both sides by    Subtracting from both sides    Dividing both sides by    (b) Give the solution of the equation .      A           (a) What operation on both sides of the equation isolates the variable on one side? There may be more than one correct answer.   Dividing both sides by    Add to both sides    Take the square root of both sides    Multiply both sides by    Square both sides    (b) Give the solution of the equation .      E           (a) The equation can be solved by performing two operations on both sides. State the operations in order of use. There may be more than one correct answer.   Divide both sides by first, then subtract from both sides    Divide both sides by first, then subtract from both sides    Subtract from both sides first, then divide by    Subtract from both sides first, then subtract from both sides    None of the above methods solves this equation.    (b) Give the solution of the equation .      B          Write down in words exactly was done at each step in the following process to solve       We wish to solve the equation   In this equation the expression on the left-hand side doesn't represent a process that seems to be easily undone. Our first step is to clear the denominator from the left-hand side. This might seem to initially take us backwards as then we have variables on both sides of the equation. However, the resulting equation is more easily solved. Now we will pause for a moment. Looking at the left-hand side of this equation now, we can read it as the following sequence of steps spplied to the variable:  S1: Multiply by   S2: Add to S1 .  The right-hand side of the equation says that the result of this process is . Thus we can finish solving the equation as follows: Just to check, we can substitute into the original equation and see that . Hence  is a solution to the original equation.   Clearly, solving equations can be rather complicated. However, a good basic approach to solving equations is the following: Solving Algebraic Equations with One Variable    Manipulate: Arrange the equation to the form where the expression is can be broken down into steps that can be undone to get down to .   Undo: Undo the steps (invert the operations) in the expression you got above in the reverse order the expression does them.   A good exercise right now is to look back at , , and to see how this process was carried out in each case.  It would be impossible to write down an example of every solution method for every equation. In fact, there are many equations cannot be solved by any algebraic methods. However, if you just apply the manipulations given above to get equivalent equations, you can solve many of the equations you might encounter. Becoming proficient will require plenty of thoughtful practice.    Solve the following equations for the indicated variable. It's a good idea to do this very carefully and writing down where you are in the solving process outlined in as you work through each one.      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for .      . Solve for . Hint: This is really two equations; if the absolute value is , then the value could be positive or negative .        Solutions from Factoring  In Chapter 1 we observed that for any real number . In this section (and frequently from now on) we will use the following important fact:   Zero Factors Theorem  If then either or .   This is a very powerful fact for solving equations. Using this, if we can break a complicated expression into a product of simpler expressions, then the complicated expression is zero only if one of the simpler expressions is zero. This is the main reason we factor algebraic expressions.   Earlier we solved the equation by inspection. Now we can solve it by factoring. Our first step is to put this equation in the form so that we may apply the Zero Factors Theorem after factoring the expression on the left-hand side. We do this by subtracting the over to the left-hand side, then proceeding as follows: Now we use the Zero Factors Theorem; either or . Hence our solutions are and .   (Important!) Note that the Zero Factors Theorem only works if the product is equal to zero.     Solve each of the following equations by factoring. Enter your answers as a comma separated list.                                                      Sometimes it is not obvious that factoring will be helpful to solve an equation. However, after a little manipulation we see that many equations can be solved using factoring as the critical step.   Solve   It is not obvious that this would lend itself to factoring. All we can do is proceed with manipulations we know are allowed, and hopefully we reach a point where we can solve. Now, by the Zero Factors Theorem, we have the solution and .     Solve the following equations:                      "

  "body": " Solving Systems of Equations     Introduce systems of algebraic equations and their solutions as multi-variable pairs (or more variables if there are more equations).    Solve systems of equations via substitution.     What if we need to solve an equation with more than one variable? For instance, consider the equation For such an equation, a solution is a pair of numbers, an -value and a -value, that make the equation true when they are both plugged in at the same time. We see that if , then makes the equation true. If , then the correct value for is . Clearly we could go on like this, obtaining a different value of for any given value of . There is no way for us to say that this equation has a single solution; it has infinitely many. Often in problems the number of solutions is narrowed down by having more equations, which we call a system of equations . For instance, we may consider the system A solution to this system of two equations is again a pair of numbers, one for each variable, that make all the equations true at the same time. For instance and is not a solution to this system; this pair makes the first equation true, but not the second. The pair and makes the second equation true, but not the first, so this is also not a solution to the system.**  So how do we find solutions to systems? The most flexible way of solving systems of equations is known as the method of substitution.   Substitution to Solve Systems of Equations  To solve a system of equations    Pick an equation and solve it for one of the variables in terms of the others.    Substitute the expression from the step above into the remaining equations.    Now the remaining equations form a system with one fewer variables and one fewer equations.    Repeat until you just have one equation and one variable that you can solve for.    Finally, back substitute the value you found to know the other variables.     Let's see this at work with the system given above. Using the first equation, we can solve for in terms of as follows: Now we substitute every time we see an in the second equation and solve for : Now we have , hence . We can now check to make sure we obtained a correct solution by plugging these values into the original system:      Solve the following systems of equations:            Solution with positive value of    Solution with negative value of               Use the first equation to solve for in terms of first.    There are two solution pairs. Use the second equation to solve for one of the variables first. There are two solution pairs.    The second equation allows you to say Use that.                                                   An exam has thirty questions. The professor subtracts eight points for each incorrect answer and adds seven points for each correct answer. If a student ends up receiving zero points, how many questions were answered correctly? Hint: Let denote the number of correct answers and denote the number of incorrect answers and set up a system of equations.      Typically you need as many equations as variables in order to not have infinitely many solutions. Use substitution to solve the following system of three equations and three unknowns:      Sometimes we need to solve a system of equations in order to manipulate an expression into another form. For instance, an important type of manipulation in Calculus and Differential Equations is known as the Partial Fraction Decomposition . In this manipulation, we take a single fraction and split it as a sum of pieces with simpler, but different, denominators. For instance, let's write in the form for some numbers and .  These two expressions are to be equivalent for all values of , we need to solve for and . To do this, set the expressions equal to one another and do some manipulations. Now we set the numerators equal: Note that like terms are grouped on both sides. Since there are zero 's on the right, we must have . Since and are numbers, we must have . Thus we have a system of equations Using the first equation we have . Substituting into the second equation we see . Hence, and .

Solve simple equations involving functions.    Find the range of a function by solving general equations for the input.      Function function  A function is a relation between two variables (the input) and (the output) where each input is related to only one output (the variables and are generic, different letters may be used).   Because this is an algebra course, most such relations will be defined by an algebraic equation with alone on one side and some algebraic expression involving on the other. We use letters to name functions; often is used if we are giving a name to a function when isn't already in use elsewhere in the problem. If is related to by the function we write We read this as equals of .    Evaluating Functions and Using Function Notation  For most people, more needs to be said about how to think about functions and how to use function notation than was given above. Suppose we are given the definition of a function as From a symbolic point of view we may think of as a certain type of shorthand.   Function Notation as Shorthand   Suppose a function defined by the equation Then we may think of as a compact way of writing what may be a complicated algebraic expression involving    Not all functions are defined using algebraic expressions. For instance trigonometric functions can only be defined using geometry and\/or concepts from calculus. However, for our purposes right now, this is an effective way to think about functions.  Because we can think of algebraic expressions as processes carried out on variables, we may also think of a function as a process performed on , resulting in . Equipped with the idea of equivalence of algebraic expressions, we may think of a function in a more conceptual way. We can think of as a factory that takes 's as raw ingredients and makes specific 's. Equivalence of the defining expressions for can be thought of as rearranging the factory, but ultimately leaving the product being produced unchanged.    Function as factory    Suppose a function defined by the equation Then we may think of is the set of all processes that result in the same outputs ( 's) as the expression . In other words, any expression that is equivalent to defines the same function, so we say it is also .    In applications, we usually think of the input as a variable we control and the output as one that results from a process. For this reason we call the input the independent variable and the output the dependent variable .  Given a function, you evaluate by plugging in the input for . The result is the value of corresponding to that -value.   Define the function by . Evaluate the following:                      The function tells us to take any input and do the following:   S1: square the input    S2: multiply S1 by    S3: subtract from S2 .  If , we will get: ; then multiply by to get ; then subtract to get . So . The output of when is .    This time, we think of as our input, a quantity that must be evaluated before is applied, so we enclose it in parentheses in the evaluation. Then we apply the steps and simplify by expanding and collecting like terms. Note that does not define the same function as ; for any -value, says that we add to and then apply all the steps of . This can be used to define another function, say .    In this part we first apply to , and then do two additional steps: multiply by and then subtract .   S4: multiply by    S5: subtract from S4 .  Here we think of as being enclosed in parentheses and simplify:          If , find the following:  (a)   (b)   (c)                           If , find the following:  (a)   (b)   (c)                          Let . Find simplified expressions for each of the following, and describe the steps they represent.                  Let and . Define another function by saying . Use algebra to show that is actually the same function as .    One important question about any given function is, \"What are its allowable inputs?\" Using the factory analogy, what raw ingredients can that factory work with? This collection of inputs has a name, the domain .  The Domain of a Function domain of a function The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs for which a defined output is produced.  One of the primary goals of Calculus is to investigate how functions behave at inputs at the boundary of the domain, hence we must be able to determine the domain. In order to determine the domain of a function, it is good to read it as a sequence of procedures, then decide if anything is not allowed at any point in that process. Those values of that force us into an operation that is not allowed with normal arithmetic are the values of that are not in the domain. For functions defined algebraically, the main things that are not allowed are:    division by zero, and    even roots of negative numbers.     Find the domain of the function defined by .  We break the function down into a sequence of steps and analyze whether any inputs must be excluded based on each step.  S1: First we subtract from . There is no value of that cannot have subtracted from it, so we have no restictions yet.  S2: Now take the square root of of the result of S1 . We cannot put a negative value under the square root sign; thus (the result of S1 must be nonnegative. Set , we can solve this to find . Thus the domain is .  Thus the domain is . (See to review interval notation.)    Find the domain of the function defined by   This function has two main parts, the numerator and denominator. Breaking down to steps for each, we have the following:   Numerator   S1: Square .  S2: Subtract from S1.   S3: Take the square root of S2.     Denominator   S4: Multiply by 2.  S5: Add to S4 .    Divide Numerator by Denominator    We can look at each part separately to determine the domain. For Numerator , we can certainly square any , and subtract . It is the square root that will be a problem. We need to have . If is between and , then is less than , so is negative. So must be excluded from the domain since these values would force us to take the square root of a negative number. For Denominator , we are not allowed to divide by zero. We will find where is zero and exclude it: . Thus the domain is all with or , except for . In interval notation, this would be written as        Find an expression for and state its domain in interval notation given that is the function that takes a real number and performs the following three steps in order:  (1) subtract 13,  (2) multiply by , and then  (3) take the square root.

Carefully explain how you found it, as illustrated in the previous example. Express your answer using inequalities and words, as well as using interval notation.             , where is the function defined in part (1) of this problem.

Sometimes the context of a problem restricts the domain of a function when the algebra may not. For instance, suppose a farmer wants to fence off a rectangular area with three sides of a rectangle, using a river as the fourth side. He has 100 yards of fence to use. Let denote the length of the side of the rectangle parallel to the river. Find a formula for the function that gives the area as a function of . What is the domain of this function based on the formula and what is it based on the context of the problem?      Solving Equations Involving Functions  In solving algebraic equations, perhaps the most straightforward ones to solve are of the form where the algebraic expression on the left represents a process applied to a variable that we may reverse to solve for . Equipped with the idea of functions, we now can simply think of these in the form More complicated equations typically have the form where and are different functions. When we think of function notation as shorthand for specified algebraic expressions, solving equations involving functions is not different than solving equations as we have before now.    Let and . Solve the following equations.                       For (a) we use the fact that , so we get the following:     For (b), we use and . Then we factor to solve:     For (c), we need to figure out what means. Now is the function that takes any input, squares it, then multiplies a new copy of it by three, then finds the difference. In this case, our input is the quantity . So we to is substitute each time we see and in the expression for and set it equal to :           Suppose .  (a) The equation can be written  .  (b) Solve .  =                     Suppose .  (a) Calculate exactly the value of when . Simplify your answer as much as possible. Enter a fraction instead of a decimal.    (b) Calculate exactly the value of when . Simplify your answer as much as possible.               SOLUTION (a) (b) We have so, solving for ,          Let . Solve the following equations, if possible. If it is impossible to solve, explain why.                     As seen in part (3) of the last question, some numbers may not appear as outputs of a given function. The set of numbers that do appear as outputs of a given function is called the range range of a function of the function. Another way to say what the range of is, is that it is the set of such that there is a solution to the equation . Finding the range of a function is generally a more difficult task than finding its domain; being able to find the maximum and\/or minimum possible outputs of a given function is one of the main achievements of Calculus. However, in many cases we can determine the range of an algebraically defined function by some combination of the following:    Determine what arithmetic operations the function applies to its input, and think about what the possible results could be.    Solve the general equation for , if possible. The result will be an expression involving ; the range of will be the -values that can be substituted into this expression.     Find the range of the following functions:                            This is the function from Question 4.10. If we solve the equation for , we have the general solution The only -value that cannot be substituted into this is . Thus, the range of is all real numbers except . Using inequalities, we would write or . In interval notation, it would be written as .   Remark: For problems involving domain and range, using inequalities to describe the domain and range may be preferable to interval notation. This is because inequalities make explicit which variables are elements of the domain (the input variable) and the range (the output variable).    For this problem, we can use our understanding of the defining expression to find the range. The function takes and subtracts three from it, squares the result, multiplies that by , and finally adds four. Noting that squares are never negative, will never be positive. This means no positive number is ever added to four. A little thought shows that any number less than or equal to four is an output of this function. So the range is .    Algebraically solving for yields . No values of make the right-hand side of this equation undefined, so the range is .    For this problem, we must note the domain of the function before determining the range. Because of the inclusion of the term, the domain of is . Possible outputs of over this domain are all numbers greater than or equal to three. Putting this together with the possible outputs of the expression , we see the range of is .         Determine the domain and range of the following functions. Explain your answers carefully as in the last example.                 "

Evaluate functions and solve equations of the form , where is constant, using the graph of a function.    Find the domain and range of a function from its graph.     Until now, our development has regarded a function as only slightly different than an algebraic expression. Algebraic expressions represent processes applied to their variables (the inputs), just like functions. The function concept blends this idea with solving equations by considering the evaluation result (the output) as a key piece; the output is a number that the function can equal for some input, which may be solved for. The graph of a function takes us a step further, so that we may see the totality of all inputs and outputs of the function as a single object, the graph of the function.  The graph of a general function of the form is a set of points in the -plane (or whatever the input and output variables happen to be). To plot a single point in the -plane, we move a distance of along the -axis (the horizontal axis), then a vertical distance from there (the vertical axis is the -axis as in the following figure:   Plotting the point in the plane.

When a general pattern is evident, we usually fill in between the plotted points with a smooth curve.   Sketch the graph of the function .  First, we will find some pairs of points on the graph by evaluating the function for some -values and recording the results in a table:  Input-output table for .                         Then we plot the points according to the table and fill in a curve:  The graph of .

Equipped with graphs of functions, we may now catalog graphical interpretations of many of the skills and concepts we have encountered so far.   Graphical Interpretations of Algebraic Skills with Functions    To evaluate a function at some value , move to the position on the horizontal axis and then find the vertical coordinate on the graph above or below that point.

  "body": " Composite and Inverse Functions     Compose functions using function notation.    Decompose complicated functions as compositions of simpler functions by displaying the defining algebraic expression as a sequence of steps.    Find the inverse of a function using a sequence of inverse operations and by using algebra.    Graph an inverse function given the graph of a function.     On many occasions we have broken down algebraic expressions as a sequence of steps, often determined by order of operations. Now that we have the concept of a function, we may view this breaking down in terms of function composition or decomposition. Simply put, we may view each step in a sequence of operations defining a function as a function in its own right. For instance, consider the function defined by the algebraic expression in . This function is When we broke down that expression, we noted that it takes and does the following:   S1:  multiplies by ,   S2:  adds one to S1    S3:  squares S2 , and finally   S4:  subtracts two from S3 ,    For each , this process produces an output . Now, we can think about this as two processes, one that does the first two steps S1 and S2 , and one that does the last two steps S3 and S4 . For the first two steps, we can use the function The last two steps then are performed on the output of by another function Symbolically, we substitute the expression for into for to get our expression for : In general, a new function constructed out of a pair of functions and is called the composition of with function composition . The function is referred to as the inside function and is referred to as the outside function . The inputs of the composition are the inputs of the inside function and the outputs are the outputs of the outside function.    If and , then both and make sense. Find them. Are they the same?       Express the function as a composition of two simpler functions and .  =  =    sqrt(u)    x^2+9           The two functions and share either an inside function or an outside function.  (a) What is this shared function?  =  Is an inside function or an outside function?   Choose    Inside    Outside    (b) Writing for this shared function, express in terms of .  =  (c) Writing for this shared function, express in terms of .  =                             Often we decompose functions by finding inside and outside functions that are easier to work with than the composite. One task that we do this for is finding domains and ranges of composites. For instance, consider the function Decompose this function into a composition of simpler functions to find its domain and range.  This may be decomposed as where and . The domain of the composite is those inputs of the inside function that, when the inside function is applied, result in legal inputs of the outside function. The domain of the outside function is , hence we must find 's such that the output of is non-negative. This occurs only if or as numbers between and will square to something less than one. Thus the domain is or . The outputs of over this domain are all , thus the entire range of will be covered. Thus the range of is all .     Decompose as an inside function and outside function and use that decomposition to find the domain of as in the previous example.    Function composition occurs quite frequently in familiar practical applications when we have one quantity depending on another, which depends on another third quantity. For instance, let be the distance, in miles, you have driven since you filled your tank and let If we have be the distance driven as a function of time, in hours, then      Suppose is the radius, in centimeters, of a circle at time minutes, and is the area, in square centimeters, of a circle of radius centimeters.  Which of the following statements best explains the meaning of the composite function ?    The area of a circle, in square centimeters, of radius centimeters.    The area of a circle, in square centimeters, at time minutes.    The radius of a circle, in centimeters, at time minutes.    The function of the minutes and the area.    None of the above     SOLUTION  is the area, in square centimeters, of the circle at time minutes.       One important application of the idea of function composition is that of inverse functions . In short, the inverse of a given function undoes the action of that function, so composition gets you back to where you started. This leads us to the following formal definition:  Inverse Function inverse function  Given a function , the inverse function to is the function such that The inputs of the inverse function are the outputs of , the outputs of the inverse function are the inputs of , and the two functions undo one another.   Note that the notation for an inverse function looks like an exponent of . It is not an exponent! This is just notation for the undoing function. It is kind of confusing and not confusing at the same time. On the one hand, you have to know it's not an exponent. On the other, remember that multiplying by the reciprocal undoes multiplication. This is similar because applying the inverse function to an output of a function undoes the function.   Consider the function defined by the expression By breaking this down into steps (decomposing the function), construct the inverse function by reversing the order and inverting each operation.  The expression defining this function breaks down as follows:  S1: Subtract from .  S2: Cube S1 .  S3: Add to S2 .  The result of this process . Now build the reverse-inverse process to get from back to :  S3 : Subtract from .  S2 : Take the cube root of S3 .  S1 : Add to S2 .  That process takes us from back to , thus we are able to sequentially build the inverse function    In the definition of an inverse function ( ) we said that is the function that undoes  . Now let's think about how we can use that idea to solve equations. For instance, take the function from . Suppose we wish to solve the equation We can read that as asking, If , then what is the ? The answer is simple; if we apply the function that undoes to , then we'll find the . Hence the solution is If we wanted to solve then we just plug that number into the inverse function. This idea generalizes to the following:  Inverse Function as Equation Solver  If is an invertible function (see ), then the solution to the equation is   The characterization of an inverse function as an equation solving function allows us to give an algebraic procedure for finding expressions of inverse functions even when we may not see how to reverse the process of the given function; simply write down the equation defining the function , and solve for in terms of .   Find the inverse of the function   (Solving for in terms of .) Note that this function is the left-hand side of the equation we solved in . In that example the right-hand side was . Now we can just follow through the same solving procedure, except with a generic : Thus we have   (Undoing a process.) Another (not super obvious) way of expressing this function is While this expression isn't a single fraction, it allows us to break down to the process  S1: Subtract from .  S2: Take the reciprocal of S1 .  S3: Multiply S2 by .  S4: Add S3 to .  The result of this process is . Now we may undo each step starting with :  S4 : Subtract from .  S3 : Divide S4 by .  S2 : Take the reciprocal of S3 .  S1 : Add to S2 .  The end result is which you may check is equivalent to the inverse function found by solving.     Find the inverse for the function You may do this by either method shown in the previous example by noting that    A practical interpretation of inverse functions is evident when you want to reverse the roles of input and output in some situation, as the next two Checkpoints illustrate.     If represents the time in hours it takes to drive to the next town at velocity mph.  Which if the following statement(s) correctly explain the meaning of ? Check all that may apply.

The velocity in mph of the car if it takes hours to drive to the next town.    How many hours it takes to reach a velocity of mph.    The velocity in mph of the car after you have driven for miles.    None of the above     SOLUTION The inverse function represents the velocity needed for a trip of hours. Its units are mph.          The table below shows the cost, , of a taxi ride as a function of the number of miles, , traveled.     0  1  2  3  4  5     0  5.5  9  12.5  16  19.5    (a) Estimate .    Which of the statements best explains the meaning of ?   The cost of traveling 2.50 miles in a taxi.    The number of miles that can be traveled for 2.50 dollars.    Taking a taxi ride for 2.50 miles.    None of the above    (b) Assume that is invertible. Estimate .    Which of the statements best explains the meaning of ?   The number of miles that can be traveled for 13.38 dollars.    Taking a taxi ride for 13.38 miles.    The cost of traveling 13.38 miles in a taxi.    None of the above           A   SOLUTION (a) is the fare for a ride of 2.50 miles. dollars. (b) is the number of miles you can travel for dollars. Traveling one mile costs dollars. Between 1 and 3 miles the increase in cost is dollars, so beyond one mile the fare rate is dollars for every miles, or dollars per mile. Using point-slope form for an equation for a line through the point with slope , we find that . Setting , we obtain , which can be solved for miles.       The graph of the inverse to a given function has a particularly nice relationship to the graph of its parent function. To graph the inverse to a function , simply take the entire picture of the graph of , including axis labels , and reflect it across the line through the origin making a 45 degree angle with the positive axis.   Graph of and .        Why does it often not make sense to graph and on the same set of axes? Hint: See the previous Checkpoints.    Invertibility of a Function  So far we have avoided too much discussion of the formal definition of a function given in . The important detail is that a function may only have one input for each output. This makes a function well-defined in the sense that if we put an input in we know what we get out without having to choose one of many possibilities. Because the normal operations of arithmetic are well-defined, whenever we define a function of the form we get a well-defined function.  Now we need to refer to that definition more explicitly to say whether a function has an inverse function. To have an inverse function, a given function must have the property that for every output ( -value) there is only one input ( -value). Such functions are called one-to-one . If a function is not one-to-one, then the inverse is not a well-defined function. For instance, is not invertible. For every output , there would be two possible inputs and (this function is two-to-one).   "

Introduction to Linear Functions  Linear functions make up perhaps the most important class of functions in mathematics. Indeed, the basic premise of Calculus is to approximate more complicated functions with linear ones. However, despite their importance to higher mathematics, they come up in rather simple real world settings.   Fired Up Pizzeria charges for a 12 inch pizza with no toppings, then an additional per topping. Let's consider the function that takes as an input the number of toppings, , and gives the cost of a pizza, , in dollars. Construct a formula for this function and show its graph.  We first give a table of values for its outputs for several inputs:     toppings          dollars           The critical thing we notice in this table is that each time the input increases by one unit, an additional is added to the cost. Hence, the number of times we add to the initial ( ) cost of is equal to the input . This process of repeated addition is precisely the definition of adding to , hence we have the formula Using the table and\/or the formula, we may then graph .  The graph of .

Due to the geometric properties of triangles, we see that the ratio of the change in the output divided by the change input is always equal to . This value is called the slope of this line.    Using the introductory example given above, we may characterize linear functions as in the following table:  Linear Function linear function  A Linear Function is      Linear Function   A process applied to the input that adds a fixed amount to the output for each additional unit of input.      A function of the form , where and are constants.      A function whose graph is a non-vertical line.      Note that when we say that a function is of the form , what we really mean is that it can be put into that form throught some algebraic manipulation. The graphical meaning of the parameters and are as follows:    Graphical Meaning of and      is the slope slope of the line. That is, given two points and , that lie on the graph of , is the ratio     If , then the graph increases from left to right.    If , then the graph decreases from left to right.    If , then the graph is a horizontal line at height .    If is larger, the the line is steeper.       is the output of when . In other words, it is the -intercept of the graph of .

Slope =  (c) Find the slope of the line connecting the point to the point .  Slope =  (d) Could the table below represent a linear function?   ?

If it is not a linear function, enter NONE .                                      Match the function with one of the graphs below.        A  B        C  D    Error: alt_print_q: Unknown displayMode: PTX.  Note:  You can click on the graphs to enlarge the images.         Because a line is uniquely determined by two points, it is possible to find the formula for a linear function whose graph contains a given pair of points (provided the two points do not lie on a vertical line). For instance, suppose we are given that and are on the graph of . Find the values of and , and hence the formula for .  First we compute the slope: Then we use the facts that is of the form and one of the two points is on the graph by substituting and solving for : Thus . Another way to see how this process works is by noting that is added to the output for every extra unit of input. By starting at and subtracting once to get back to when , we also get .      Find the equation of the line through the points and . Write your answer in the form , using fractions (no decimal numbers).                In the last example, we noted that finding the formula for a linear function would not work if the line was vertical. Explain the following:      You cannot determine the slope of a vertical line from two points on that line.      The equation of a vertical line has the form , where is a number.      In practical applications, one can often recognize linear functions by noting a constant rate of change parameter.   Suppose we wish to find a formula for the profit of selling widgets. This is the revenue we get from selling the widgets minus the cost of producing them. Suppose we sell the widgets for a piece, and it costs to set up production, plus to make each widget.  Observe that the units of on the selling price and production cost are both rates of change of the form . This, along with the fact that these rates are constant, indicates the function is likely a linear function. Going to the formula we get This simplifies to the linear function Here we see that will be spent no matter how many widgets are sold, and we get a net profit of for each widget sold.      You want to choose one long distance telephone company from the following options:  Company A charges $0.37 dollars per minute (no fixed monthly charge).  Company B charges $13.75 per month plus $0.26 per minute.  Company C charges a fixed rate of $50 per month.  Let , , and denote the monthly charges of Company A, B, and C respectively for spending minutes on long distance calls.  (a) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company A, :    (b) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company B, :    (c) Find a formula for the monthly cost of using Company C, :    (d) If you spend 125 minutes talking long distance in a month, which of the three companies will be cheapest? Enter the letter (A, B, or C) here:  (e) Given the graph below, match the number of each graph to corresponding company it represents:     Company A     Company B     Company C                      A                  SOLUTION (a) If you use no minutes (when ), the cost . So the -intercept . Also, the slope is since every time increases by 1, your monthly cost increases by $0.37 . Thus the equation for company A is . (b) The fixed monthly cost (if ), is . So the -intercept . Also, the slope is since every time increases by 1, your monthly cost increases by $0.26 . Thus the equation for company B is . (c) The slope is since the monthly cost is constant, . The equation for company C is . (d) If you use 125 minutes, then the monthly bill for Company A would be $46.25, the monthly bill for Company B would be $46.25, and the monthly bill for Company C is always $50. Since Company A charges $46.25, it would have the cheapest monthly bill. (e) The blue, horizontal line 3 is the graph of Company C since its graph has slope 0. The green line 1 through the origin is the graph of Company A's cost since Company A has no fixed monthly charge. The red line 2 is matched with Company B since company B has a positive slope and a positive -intercept.         A ski shop rents skis for a fixed initial payment of dollars and a charge of dollars per day they are used. If a skier pays a total of dollars, what is the meaning of the number ? Explain your answer as completely as possible.      Forms of Linear Functions  The form of a linear function is known as slope-intercept form . It is a very useful form. A more general (but non-unique) form is known as point-slope form .     Write the equation for the line in the form slope-intercept form, and enter it in this form.              Point-Slope Form of a Linear Function point-slope form  The linear function of slope passing through the point has the form    In order to understand point-slope form, all you need to do is ask (and answer) the following two questions:    Is the formula for a linear function with slope ? The answer is yes. All one needs to do is simplify and collect like terms to see that . Thus we can say .    Does the graph of pass through the point ? Again the answer is yes because .    The graphical difference between point-slope form and slope-intercept form is that slope-intercept form puts on display the -intercept, whereas slope-intercept form displays another point on the graph. Equipped with point-slope form, it is somewhat easier to find a formula for a linear function given two points; all you need to do is compute the slope.     A line s equation is given in point-slope form:   This line s slope is .  A point on this line that is apparent from the given equation is .             Compare the given equation with a generic point-slope equation:   We can see the slope is , and an apparent point on the line is .           Write an equation for the line through the points and in point-slope form .   +                     The slope-intercept form of the formula for a linear function is actually equal to the point-slope form for a specific point on the graph. What point is that?    Since the graphs of linear functions are lines, it makes sense to ask whether the two lines are parallel or perpendicular. To see whether two lines are parallel, they simply must have the same slope. So see whether two lines are perpendicular, consider the following figure:   Perpendicular lines with triangles indicating their slopes.      From this (with triangles added to illustrate slope), we see that the magnitude of the change in for an associated change in on one graph is the same as the magnitude of the change in for an associated change in on the perpendicular graph. Also, the sign of the slope is opposite. Hence the slope of a line perpendicular to a line of slope is .     Find the equation of the line though the point and perpendicular to the line . Write your answer in the form .                 Write an equation for the line through the point and parallel to the line in point-slope form .   +                    How can you tell the lines and never intersect, without doing any algebra?      Do the graphs of and intersect? Why or why not?      Applications of Linear Functions  Linear functions arise in real-world applications involving one variable that changes at a constant rate relative to another. Once the linear function is found, the problems usually boil down to    finding an output for a given input (evaluating),    finding the input for a given output (solving a simple equations), or    finding when two linear functions are equal (find when graphs intersect).    Each of these problems is actually relatively straightforward from an algebraic point of view, given that you have formulas for your functions. The main difficulty is turning the words of the real world into mathematics.    As one climbs a mountain, the air temperature decreases by about F for every foot increase in elevation. Suppose the temperature is F when at an elevation of feet above sea level. Suppose we want the answer to the following questions:    What will the temperature be at an elevation of feet?    What should the elevation be to be a crisp room temperature of F?      Our first task must be to find a formula for temperature as a function of elevation. To achieve this, we first have to name variables (this can be hard at first). Let be the temperature, in F, at an elevation feet above sea level. The problem describes a rate of change of in F\/ft; this will be the slope of our linear function. This slope can often be seen using the units as the units of slope must be output units divided by input units. The sign is negative because the temperature decreases at this rate as increases. The problem then describes a point on the graph of this function, . Using point-slope form, we have The answer to part (a) is then obtained by substituting for to get To answer part (b), we need to substitute for , and solve for :        A theater manager graphed weekly profits as a function of the number of patrons and found that the relationship was linear. One week profit was $10,444 when 1316 patrons attended. Another week 1526 patrons produced a profit of $12,334.  (a) Find a formula for weekly profit, , as a function of the number of patrons, . Do not enter any commas in your formula.    (b) How much will profits increase if 1 more patron goes to the theater?  $ (no comma in your answer)  (c) What number of patrons is closest to the break-even point (that is, the number of patrons for which there is as close to zero profit as possible)?  number = patrons (no comma in your answer)  d) Find a formula for the number of patrons as a function of the profit. Do not enter any commas in your formula.    f) If the weekly profit was $15,934, how many patrons attended the theater? number = patrons (no comma in your answer)                            SOLUTION a) We are given two points on the line, (1316, 10444) and (1526, 12334). We can compute the slope Then we use the point (1316, 10444) to solve for the -intercept , so . The equation is therefore . b) This is the slope of the line, $9 per patron. c) To find the break-even point, we find the number of patrons, , that makes the profit , equal to 0, i.e. we set equal to zero and solve for . Because we don't expect fractional patrons, the correct number is the rounded value . d) Rewriting our expression in (a): e) If the profit was $15,934, the number of patrons would be          Consider the example . Why is the formula for as a function of given in the last example more useful to a climber whose elevation is near 2000 feet than to one near sea level? What equivalent formula would be more useful to someone near sea level? Explain.      The ideal gas law says that where is the pressure of a gas, is its volume, is its temperature in C, is the number of moles of gas, is a constant, and is the value of absolute zero in C. If and are constant, like when the gas is in a sealed container, we have a linear function for as a function of :      What is the slope of the graph of (just in symbols, not the number)?      Suppose we measure to be when , and when . Find the slope of the graph of from this data.      Use the data and the value of the slope from part (b) to give an approximate value of . Is this close to the value you may have learned in a science class (or can look up)?        "

Know the different algebraic forms of quadratic functions and the meanings of their associated parameters.    Find formulas for quadratic functions from data (both purely numerical and in context) to solve problems.    Solve equations involving quadratic functions in abstract and applied settings.      Introduction to Quadratic Functions  Quadratic functions are probably the simplest non-linear functions to study. The adjective quadratic comes from the Latin word for square, quadratus . This is because the addition of a term involving comes from measuring areas. Thinking of quadratic functions as ones that measure rectangular areas is what allows us to see that quadratic functions can be used to model positions of objects whose acceleration is constant.  quadratic function  A quadratic function is one of the form , where , , and are constants with .       Express the quadratic function in standard form and identify the coefficients and .  =  =  =                          Express the quadratic function in standard form .  =              Let us consider the simplest possible quadratic function . Graph this function and describe its features.  By plotting points, we may construct its graph:  The graph of .      There are several observations we can make about the graph, along with connections to the algebraic expression defining this function.    Our first observation is that the outputs of are never negative. This is simply due to the fact that the square of any real number is either zero (only when ) or positive. Not all quadratic functions have non-negative graphs, but the fact that is never negative will be very useful in analyzing other quadratic functions.    Another observation is that the graph is symmetric about the -axis. This is because for any real number , . Thus the output is the same at as it is for . We will see that the graph of every quadratic function has some vertical axis of symmetry.    We see that the graph is concave-up concave-up . That is, as you move from left to right, the slope between points on the graph is increasing. More precisely, using the input-output table  Values for                         we may construct an table of slopes:  Slope Table for    Points on the Graph  and  and  and  and  and  and    Slope of Connecting Line           We see that the slope is increasing. Observing that the slope actually increases by a constant amount for constant steps from left to right is the key to applications of quadratic functions. If the slope were decreasing as we moved from left to right, we would say the graph is concave down.     These are the observations we made about , which has parameters , , and . Throughout this section we will see how the parameters , , and affect the placement of the maximum or minimum output, the axis of symmetry, and the concavity of the graph of a quadratic function, as well as their practical implications.      In the definition of a quadratic function ( ), it was noted that the parameter could not be zero. Why would we insist that be nonzero to define a quadratic function? What do we call a function of the form when ?    Just as the parameters and have graphical interpretations for the family of linear functions, the parameters , , and have graphical interpretations for quadratic functions. However, because the family of quadratic functions involves three parameters instead of two, they are more complicated. Before reading the next paragraph, use the interactive graph below to experiment by changing the parameters , , and to see how they change the graph and describe the changes in your own words. Then click to expose the next paragraph, which describes them in the words of a math book.   Meanings of , , and in Quadratic Functions    First let's deal with the parameter . This one is simple; it's just the output of when . Thus the -intercept of is at .    The second easiest parameter to understand is . The sign of tells use whether the parabola (the graph of a quadratic function is called a parabola parabola ) is concave up or concave down. To see this, notice that if is positive, then for very large values of , is positive and larger in absolute value than both and . This means that the parabola must be opening up. Likewise, if is negative, then the parabola is concave down.    The parameter is more complicated, and we will leave its exact meaning when we discuss the vertex of a parabola.        Use properties of functions to match each of the following functions with its graph. Do not use your calculator. Clicking on a graph will give you an enlarged view.                Error: PGbasicmacros: imageRow: Unknown displayMode: PTX.  Error: PGbasicmacros: imageRow: Unknown displayMode: PTX.        One of the primary skills associated to any family of functions is solving equations of the form When is a quadratic function, we have already discussed one of the most important solution methods: factoring. To solve an equation of the form one must just subtract from both sides, factor, and use the zero factors principle to solve. The -intercepts, or zeros, of a quadratic function can be seen when we write it in factored form: In this form is the same as it is in the expanded form, while and are the zeros. Notice that not all quadratic functions can be put into factored form as they may not have any real zeros.      Find the zeros of If more than one zero exists, enter your answers as a comma separated list. If no zeroes exist, enter NONE .  The zeros are         SOLUTION In order to find the zeros, we set the function equal to zero and solve for by factoring: Since and are factors, there are two zeros at and .          Find the zero(s) (if any) of the function  Enter your answer as a comma separated list. If no real zeros exist, enter NONE .  The zero(s) is\/are         SOLUTION To find the zeros, we solve the equation . We see that this is factorable, as . Therefore, the zeros occur where and .         When , we can use the factors and to really see what the graph of looks like, and how influences it. In what follows, suppose and are generic real numbers with .      On a single set of axes graph the lines and . Use this graph to find the values of where and have the same sign and where they have different signs. Use this do decide when is positive and when it is negative.      Use your answers from part (a) to sketch a graph of .      Using your graph from part (b) and reasoning from part (a), explain why the sign of the parameter tells you whether the graph of opens up or down.        Forms of Quadratic Functions  There are three very useful forms of a quadratic function . The first two are familiar at this point:    Standard Form: .    Factored Form: .    The third form is new, and is the quadratic analogue of the point-slope form of a linear function.  Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function  Every quadratic function may be put in the form The axis of symmetry of the graph is , and the maximum (if ) or minimum (if ) output of is .   The usefulness of vertex form is well illustrated in the following example:    Let . We wish to    Find the zeros of .    Find the maximum or minimum possible output of . This will tell you the range of .    Sketch the graph of .        Based on prior experience, one may be tempted to expand to standard form and factor. Doing this we obtain the equation However, when we try to factor, we see there aren’t any ways to do it using only integers. On further reflection, we can see that the vertex form makes it easier to solve, because it breaks a quadratic function into a straightforward process applied to the variable . From the vertex form we can say this function does the following:    subtract from     square S1     multiply S2 by , and finally    adds to S3 .    The reverse process applied to any output of will be    subtract     and divide by , then    take the positive or negative square root, and finally    add .    Applying this to zero, we get the zeros We can apply this to any proposed output, as long as the thing we need to take the square root of is not negative. Note: This reverse process does not actually describe an inverse function; the step where the reverse process allows for multiple possibilities prevents this process from defining a function, which must only yield one input for each output.    A slight rearrangement of the vertex form to look like makes it clear that the range is all . Because is never negative, some quantity is always being subtracted from . The maximum possible output is also clearly , and it occurs when . We can also see this from an algebraic expression for the reverse process applied to : The possible values of in this expression are those that make non-negative. Thus we must have .    Plotting the vertex, the -intercept, and a few points to the left and right of the vertex gives us a good graph:   The graph of .               Find the minimum and maximum value of the function . Enter infinity or -infinity if the function never stops increasing or decreasing.  Maximum value =  Minimum value =                    In the last example, we found the zeros of to be . The zeros are also supposed to appear in the factored form as and . Expand the right-hand side of the equation and collect like terms to verify that    One must now ask how we find the vertex form of a given quadratic function, also sometimes called completing the square .There are a number of ways to do this. The way we present is very flexible, and may be modified to find useful formulas for many other types of functions. To find the vertex form, simply write down the proposed form with and , then expand and collect like terms to get a system of equations that you may solve for and . The following example illustrates this procedure nicely.  To find the vertex form, proceed as follows:   Write down standard form equal to the proposed form with and .   Expand and collect like terms on the right-hand side.    Match coefficients of powers of on the left- and right-hand sides to obtain a system of equations to solve for and . The color coding is equivalent to the system of equations Given , , and we can solve this system for , , and .  The following example illustrates this procedure nicely.  The following example illustrates this procedure nicely; once you have numbers in for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), it's easier than the above procedure may seem.  Find the vertex form of and use it to find the zeros of .  We see , thus we must have Now we match like terms on either side of the equation to obtain the system of equations Solving this system we have and . As in the last example, we can solve in a straightforward way to get .   One may find the vertex form of a quadratic in full generality in terms of the parameters , , and ( Do not attempt to memorize this! ): It is easier to just set up and solve the system of equations, which you'll get faster at with practice, than to commit this to memory. The only reason to write down the general formula for vertex form is to derive the quadratic formula for the zeros of a quadratic ( You should probably memorize this. ): Observe that is where the vertex is, which is halfway between the zeros. This may be seen as the graphical meaning of the parameter .     Use the quadratic formula to find the zeros of the function in the above example, . Simplify your answer to show that it is equivalent to the answer given in the example.       (a) Complete the square by writing in the form . Note: the numbers and can be positive or negative.        (b) Solve the equation by completing the square or using the quadratic formula. If there is more than one correct answer, enter your answers as a comma separated list. If there are no real solutions, enter NONE.  =                              Find the vertex form of the following quadratic functions. Use it to find the maximum or minimum output as well as the zeros of each function, if the zeros exist. Simplify your answers as much as possible, but do not use a calculator.                     The following is a summary of the forms of a quadratic function and what their parameters mean.   Forms of a Quadratic Function, , and What the Parameters Mean    Standard form:     The -intercept of the graph of is at .    If , the graph is an upward opening parabola.    If , the graph is a downward opening parabola.      Factored form: .   The -intercepts (if they exist) of the graph of are at and .     Vertex Form:     The vertex of the graph of is at .    This form is extremely useful for solving equations when factoring proves difficult.         Find a formula for the quadratic function whose graph is shown below:         We see that the vertex is at , hence the quadratic function may be written in the form Using the fact that is also on the graph, we have the equation Solving, we get , thus .        Determine the equation of the quadratic function graphed above. Write your answer in standard form.  Equation:                Applications of Quadratic Functions  When a quadratic function appears in an applied context, we can now answer many questions about it. We can find output values, zeros, and also its maximum or minimum output and what input causes them.      For a certain state, the function models the number of accidents, , per 50 million miles driven as a function of a driver's age, , in years, where includes drivers from ages 16 to 74, inclusive. The graph of is shown above. Use the equation for to solve:  a) Find the number of accidents per 50 million miles driven for drivers age 25.  Answer: accidents per 50 million miles  b) Find the number of accidents per 50 million miles driven for drivers age 35.  Answer: accidents per 50 million miles  c) For what value of does the graph have its lowest point? This is the age of drivers with the fewest accidents.  Answer:                  360 accidents per 50 million miles are caused by drivers age 25. b) There are 240 accidents per 50 million miles for drivers age 35. c) Drivers age 45 have the fewest accidents.       One application we can see for quadratic functions comes from their original purpose, finding areas. Now that we know how to find the vertex form of a quadratic function, we can find the maximum or minimum possible values of functions that describe area.   Suppose a farmer wants to fence off a rectangular area with three sides of a rectangle, using a river as the fourth side. She has 100 yards of fence to use and wishes to enclose as large an area as possible. Let denote the length of the side of the rectangle parallel to the river and be the length of the side perpendicular to the rive, both measured in yards.  The first thing we should do is draw a well labeled picture of the situation.     Since she has yards of fence to use, we have the relation The area is given by . To obtain the area as a function of , we substitute (from the constraint) for to get When we find the vertex form of this function we find and , hence . Thus This means the maximum area is yd , which occurs when and .     How much fence would the farmer in the last problem need if she wanted the maximum possible enclosed area to be yd ?   Let be the total amount of fencing used, in yards, and use the vertex form. Notice that if the amount enclosed is to be yd , then we must have . A careful read of the solution in the example tells us that . This and knowing will allow you to solve for .   One of the most important applications of quadratic functions comes as a prelude to really doing differential Calculus. The application is modeling the motion of objects with constant acceleration. It was Galileo Galilei who reasoned that all massive objects objects accelerate at the same constant rate when dropped, no matter what the mass is (neglecting air resistance). What we would like to do is construct a function that gives the height of a dropped object seconds after it was dropped. What type of function should we use? We know that linear functions have a constant rate of change, thus if a linear function is used to describe the position of a moving object, that object's velocity must be constant. This would mean its acceleration must be zero. To model an object whose acceleration is a nonzero constant, we must construct a function whose rate of change changes at a constant rate.  Let's consider a candidate quadratic function . In order to find the rate of change of the rate of change (let's call this quantity acceleration), we must first find its rate of change for a small change, , in . To figure this out, let's think flexibly about the terms of as areas being summed up. The constant term, , can represent a rectangle, which does not change at all for a change in . The term can represent a rectangle. If the side of length increases by , the area increases by as in the following figure:       The shaded area is the total change in . Dividing this by to make it a rate of change, we find that the rate of change in is (this should not be surprising, is linear with slope ). Now we will consider the term as the area of a rectangle. If changes by , the total change in is represented by the shaded area in the following figure:       Thus the total change in for a change in of is given by . Dividing by to obtain a rate of change, we get . Hence the total rate of change in , at a given value changing by , is Considering to be infinitesimally small , we find the instantaneous rate of change (velocity) is . This is a linear function with slope ! That means that its (velocitiy's) rate of change (acceleration) is constant and equal to . This means we have a new characterization of quadratic functions to go along with their algebraic form:   A Quadratic Function is      Linear Function   A function of the form , where , , and are constants.      A function whose graph is a parabola.      A function whose second rate of change (acceleration) is constant.       Remark: The idea of computing instantaneous rates of change is central to Calculus. Re-read this section carefully now, then do it again when you learn about derivatives when you take Calculus.   Now back to Galileo's problem. He measured the acceleration of an object to be downward at m\/s . Thus, to model the height of a projectile, we should use a quadratic function with leading term . The initial velocity, , should be the constant term of the velocity function ( above), so the linear term should be . The initial height is just the vertical intercept. Hence we have the formula for the height of a object, in meters after seconds, with initial height and initial velocity :     To find when it hits the ground, find the larger of its zeros.    To find the maximal height, find the vertex.        The height (in feet) of a ball thrown by a child is where is the horizontal distance in feet from the point at which the ball is thrown.  (a) How high is the ball when it leaves the child's hand? (Hint: Find when .) feet  (b) What is the maximum height of the ball? feet  (c) How far from the child does the ball strike the ground? feet                         What is the instantaneous rate of change in ? Explain why your answer is correct using the volume of a cube as in     "

Manipulate and use different algebraic forms of exponential functions and the meanings of their associated parameters.    Find formulas for exponential functions from data (both purely numerical and in context) to solve problems.      Intro to Exponential Functions  Exponential functions are common in applications where the rate of change is not described in absolute terms, but in relative terms as a percent rate of change. For instance, suppose we say a population, , is growing at a rate of per year with an initial value of . This means that to find the population next year, we find the population of the current year, multiply it by , and add it to the current population. Then we can construct a table of values, with the input being measured in years:  Input-Output Table for                   We can notice that the slope, which is the absolute rate of change, is not constant. Between the points and , the slope is . The slope between the points and is . However, if we take the ratio of consecutive outputs, we get a constant: What this shows is that each time the input increases by , the output gets multiplied by one more time. Since repeated multiplication is denoted by an exponent, we see that Functions with this basic form are known as exponential functions.  Explonential Function exponential function  An exponential function is a function of the form , where and .   As is always the case with functions of a specified form, we mean that through algebraic manipulation we can write it in that form. In the case of exponential functions, the parameters and have important meaning (see below). For this reason we note that when we are finding and for a specific exponential function, we are looking to write it in the form     Consider the function This is an exponential function. What are the parameters and ?    It is tempting to say and . However, observe that the expression in the exponent of is not just . The definition of an exponential function, with its parameters and requires a form where the exponent is just . To obtain this form, we must use some exponent properties as follows: Thus, we have and .       Is the function below exponential?  If so, write the function in the form and enter the values you find for and in the indicated blanks below. If the function is not exponential, enter NONE in both blanks below.                 SOLUTION Yes, is exponential. It can be rewritten in standard form as So and .          Is the function below exponential?   If so, write the function in the form and enter the values you find for and in the indicated blanks below. If the function is not exponential, enter NONE in both blanks below.                 SOLUTION Yes is exponential, and we can rewrite this in standard form, , so we have and .        Consider . We can plot some points to construct a graph of this function.   The graph of .      We can make several observations about this graph and connect them to the algebraic form of this function.    First, notice that the -intercept is at . This is due to the fact that . Since any nonzero number raised to the zero power is , we are just multiplying by .    We also can notice this function is increasing as you move from left to right. In fact, you can see that each point we plotted is exactly one and a half times higher above the -axis than the point that was plotted one unit to its left. This is because the height is multiplied by each time the input increases by one unit.    If we move from right to left through negative values of , all the outputs are less than and getting smaller. This isn't a truly different observation than the last one, but it's a different perspective. This comes from the fact that when is negative, we're really dividing by positive powers of . (Review you exponent rules now if you need to.)    Finally, we notice that the outputs stay above the -axis. This is because is always positive, as it represents repeated multiplication of a positive number. If the in front were replaced by a negative number, then the output would never be positive. Exponential functions never change signs.         In the definition of an exponential function, we said that cannot be zero and had to be positive. Let's think about why we would make such restrictions.      If , what simpler family of functions does belong to?      If is negative, what is a value of that would make undefined? (The answer is not zero.)      Now is a good time to once again explore how the graph of changes when and change. Use the interactive graph below to change and and describe the changes in your own words. Again, the math book description follows.      The Meaning of and in Exponential Functions   Let where and .      is the growth factor. Each time the input increases by one unit, the output is multiplied by another factor of . Taking this statement algebraically, we have This leads us to the useful identity, A more general version of this is given by   The following observations tell us how affects the graph of :   If , then the graph diverges away from the -axis from left to right and gets arbitrarily close to the -axis as .    If , then the graph gets arbitrarily close to the -axis as , and diverges away from the -axis moving right to left.       is the output of when . In other words, it is the -intercept of the graph of .        The domain of an exponential function is the set of all real numbers. What is the range? Your answer will depend of the value of .     Suppose outputs for the function are given below.  Input-Output Table for                 The ratios of consecutive values are equal to : Thus, The value at is , so and we have       Find a possible formula for the exponential function through the points and graphed below.     (Click on graph to enlarge.)        SOLUTION If the function is exponential, its formula is of the form . Since (0,7) is on the graph when x = 0, . Using the other point at (3,448) we can solve for b : so and The formula is therefore .

We know that is exponential, so for some constants and . We know that , so Thus, . Also Thus , and we have (b) As before, if a function is linear, then the differences in successive function values will be constant. If a function is exponential, the ratios of successive function values will remain constant. Now and (and similarly for the remaining intervals). Thus, is linear. We know that is exponential, so for some constants and . We know that , so and . Then , so so , and we have        Generally, if you know one of the parameters of an exponential function and a point on its graph, you can solve for the other parameter. In the next section we will go into detail of how to find formulas for exponential functions from two points on the graph, similar to how we did it for linear functions. We will also see possible reasons for alternatives to the standard form.    Forms of Exponential Functions  Often we would like to find a formula for an exponential function when the initial condition and growth rate are not known. However, we often do know some information that is somehow equivalent to two points on the graph. To understand some of the useful forms of exponential functions, let's first figure out how to find a formula given two points on the graph.   Suppose the points and are on the graph of . We would like to determine and . To do this, we merely need to set up a system of equations and solve it. Using the input-output pairs, we have Using the first equation, we find , which we can substitute into the second to get Then we find . Thus we have .      Find the exponential function whose graph is given below.                This process for finding the equation of an exponential function is straightforward, but the final answer does not show the points the graph passes through in a transparent way. Instead, we may write it in the form In this form we can see that and quite easily.    Show the manipulations, using exponent rules, that one must use to put the function from the example into the form shown above.      Let . Find two points with integer coordinates that are obviously on the graph of . Explain why they are obvious.    Using the last two questions as motivation, we can introduce the following form of an exponential function:  Point-Factor-(Time Interval) Form for an Exponential Function  An exponential function that has the property that and grows by a factor of over each time interval has the form The initial value of this function is and its growth factor per unit increase in input is .   This particular form of an exponential function may be thought of as analogous to the point-slope form of a linear function. However, because the formula is a bit more complicated, it may be more useful to use it only implicitly, and think about why your answer is right.   Suppose a quantity grows exponentially as a function of , where when , and increases by every time increases by . Find a formula for in terms of .  Since grows by each time increases by , each time increases by , the initial quantity will be multiplied by . This means the exponent of should be divided by . Since the output is when , we can put as the numerator in the exponent. Thus we have Now we may ask ourselves whether this behaves in the specified way:    Is ? Yes, .    Is multiplied by an additional factor of each time increases by . Yes, observe     Thus we can see that this function behaves in the specified way.   Another form of an exponential function is indicated by the preceding example. Often, in real world applications, exponential functions are described by a constant percent growth rate.  Percent Growth Rate Form of an Exponential Function  Every exponential function may be written in the form In this form is the percent growth (when multiplied by ) for each unit increase in . Note:    If , then . In this case is just called the growth rate.    If , then . In this case is the decay rate.        Suppose . Give the starting value , the growth factor  , and the percent growth or decay rate  .       %   ?    growth    decay                                In the function , by what percent does grow per unit increase in ?      Applications of Exponential Functions  Standard applications of exponential functions are those related to growth and decay. We will introduce these applications now, but investigate them further when we are equipped with logarithms. Logarithms will allow us to solve equations involving exponential functions.   Suppose a population of bacteria, , in millions starts at and triples every six hours. Find a formula for as a function of time , in hours. By what percent does change each hour? Using the point-factor-time interval idea, we find In order to find the growth rate, we must first find the growth factor . This is done by applying exponent rules: Hence the growth factor is . Hence the percent growth rate is about per hour.      Nicotine leaves the body at a constant rate. At a time of hours after smoking a cigarette, mg of nicotine remain in a person's body; hours later ( hours after smoking the cigarette), there are mg of nicotine in the body.  (a) Find a formula for the amount of nicotine left in the body hours after smoking a cigarette.    (b) How much nicotine is in the body immediately after smoking.   (c) How much nicotine is in the body hours after smoking.                          Cesium-137 is a radioactive isotope formed in nuclear fission. Given that it decays at a rate of per year, what equation would you need to solve in order to find its half-life (the time it takes for half of an initial quantity to remain)?     "

We say one quantity is proportional to another if the first is a constant multiple of the second.

If an aircraft has a takeoff speed of about miles per hour, how much runway does it need?  feet               What conditions on and would place a power function into one of the other families of functions we have studied (list all possibilities)? Explain.      Are there any values of and such that a power function could be called an exponential function? Explain.    While the class of power functions still only has two parameters, we will see they are somewhat more complicated than the families of linear and exponential functions. Power functions can have a much wider array of graphs and may exhibit more complicated domains and ranges than linear or exponential functions. However, much of the complication can be worked out by remembering our rules of arithmetic.    Examples of Power Functions  Consider the following three power functions:   Their coefficients are all equal to one. Their exponents are , , and , respectively. The simplest of these to graph is :   The graph of .      We see from the graph that is similar in shape to . The outputs are never negative because the exponent is even, and the minimum output is zero. We see that the outputs grow more rapidly than those of when and decay to zero more rapidly when . This is simply a result of repeating the multiplication of by itself four times instead of two. As the exponent grows, this effect is exaggerated.  A slightly more complicated graph is that of :   The graph of .      In this graph, we never see negative outputs because the exponent is even. However, we also never see zero as an output because a fraction is only zero when its numerator is zero at the same time its denominator is not zero. The most conspicuous behavior of this function is that as gets large, and as gets close to zero, . This is a simple consequence of arithmetic; if you divide by a large number, the result is small and if you divide by a positive number very close to zero, the result is very large.  Finally, we can graph :   The graph of .      In this graph we notice that the domain is only non-negative -values. This is because even roots of negative numbers are not defined. Also, even roots of numbers are defined to be positive, so the range is all . The shape of the graph can be seen by noting that if , then . This means that the graph of is that of the positive half of , but reflected across the line .    Sketch and\/or use Desmos to generate graphs of , , and . What is the main difference between these graphs and the graphs given above, and how can you explain the difference in terms of basic arithmetic?

Solve equations using logarithms in both pure and applied settings.     Introduction to Logarithms  When working with any family of functions, two common tasks are finding a formula for a member of some specified family satisfying some conditions (often points on the graph), and solving equations involving members of that family. A little reflection on the last two families we studied (exponential and power functions) reveals that we did not solve equations involving exponential functions nor did we find formulas for power functions. This is because we need a way of solving for a variable in an exponent, which is exactly what logarithms are for.   Before giving the definition of a logarithm, it may be helpful to think about the difference between a power function and an exponential function one more time. ( This is important, don't skip reading it! ) A power function is one of the form Thinking about such a function as a process applied to the input, , we would say     raises to the -th power, then    multiplies the result by .    In order to describe what an exponential function, does to , we need the following math verb: to exponentiate exponentiate  (with a given base) means to make the exponent of . The we can describe what does as   exponentiates given a base of , then    multiplies the result by .    This distinction of what is done to by these families is deeper than just where is as a symbol; it tells us which operation must be applied to undo each process. In the both cases, undoing the function first involves division (by or ). Then, in the case of a power function, you undo raising to the -th power by taking the -th root (equivalently, raising to the -th power). In the case of the exponential function, we must undo exponentiation with a logarithm.  The Base Logarithm logarithm of base  The logarithm, base , of is defined as follows:   is the inverse function of .  Other ways of conceptualizing are as follows:     and .    The base logarithm undoes exponentiation with base .    The equation is equivalent to .      The word \"logarithm\" combines two Greek words: logos for \"ratio\" and arithmos for \"number\". The meaning translates roughly to \"number of ratios\" . Backing up to , we can recall that the base of the exponential function is the ratio of consecutive outputs. That is . Since , we can see this makes sense as is precisely the number of ratios.    The idea of a logarithm was originally introduced in 1614 by John Napier . What's interesting is that the idea of a logarithm predates a full understanding of exponents; the notation for exponents we use today was not introduced until 1637.      Find the exact value of each expression.  (a)  (b)  (a)  (b)                     Evaluate the logarithmic expression. Answer:  Note:  You cannot use any operations except division (\/) and negation (-).               What is , no matter what is. Why?      Suppose that . Explain why is positive when and is negative when .      Explain why is undefined.    One of the major difficulties of logarithms is that they cannot easily be computed by hand unless the input is an obvious power of the base; a calculator is usually required. However, there are only two logarithms programmed into most calculators, the common logarithm and the natural logarithm. The common logarithm has a base of ten and the natural logarithm has a base of . We will focus our use on the common logarithm. We will see in the next section that you really only need one logarithm.    Logarithm Properties and Solving Equations  The Common Logarithm common logarithm The common logarithm is the base- logarithm. That is, .     Express the equation in logarithmic form  (a) .  That is, write your answer in the form . Then  A=  B=  C=  (b) .  That is, write your answer in the form . Then  D=  and  E=                                    Rewrite the exponential equation in equivalent logarithmic form. There may be more than one correct answer.             None of the above         From now on we will only use the common logarithm, as logarithm properties will allow us to calculate other logarithms using the common logarithm. Properties of logarithm properties  The following properties of the common logarithm follow from familiar exponent rules:     (from )     (from )     (from )      Justification: We will justify the first property and leave the other two as an exercise. To justify the first property, observe that is the exponent of that yields , i.e. If we can show that has the same property, then property one will be proven. If we exponentiate , then we have Since both and yield when we exponentiate them with a base of , we have .    Justify properties two and three in the same manner as property one was justified.      Use the second logarithm property and the result of , part (d), to show that     In this example we see why the common logarithm is the only one we really need (although the natural logarithm is the most commonly used), as well as how we can use a logarithm to solve a simple equation. Suppose we wish to know the solution to The simple answer is . However, we cannot get a decimal approximation of this from many calculators. We can take the common logarithm of both sides of the equation Then by property three given above (you will use this property most often), we have Hence . In general,    Now that we are equipped with logarithms, we can solve equations involving exponential expressions.   Suppose we wish to solve the equation A good first step in the process is to simplify this into an equivalent equation of the form Then we can use our new tool to undo the exponentiation. Simplifying we have Now we take the common logarithm of both sides of the equation and use the third logarithm property to get Then we simply divide to solve for : This expression for simplifies to       Solve the following equation for :                   Solve the following equation for :   If there are no solutions, enter none .                 Say exactly which logarithm properties are used in simplifying to .      Applications to Exponential and Power Functions  Now we are equipped to handle some problems involving exponential and power functions.   Suppose the balance in a bank account begins at and earns interest per year. When will there be in the account?  First, we need to find a formula for the amount in the account, in dollars, as a function of the time , in years. We can quickly determine this to be Now we are faced with solving the equation Quick simplification and application of the technique from the previous section gives us Hence there will be in the account in about 19.8 years.      Nicotine leaves the body at a constant rate. At a time of hours after smoking a cigarette, mg of nicotine remain in a person's body; hours later ( hours after smoking the cigarette), there are mg of nicotine in the body.  (a) Find a formula for the amount of nicotine left in the body hours after smoking a cigarette.    (b) How much nicotine is in the body immediately after smoking.   (c) How much nicotine is in the body hours after smoking.                         Suppose a population of bacteria begins at 1,000 and grows at a rate of per hour. What is the doubling-time of this population? First we find a formula for the population, , as a function of time, , in hours: The doubling-time will then be the time it takes for the population to be , so we solve: Thus the population will double in about 11.9 hours.     Use some part of the solution in the previous example to explain why the doubling-time (or half-life) of an exponentially growing (or decaying) quantity is independent of its initial value. Hint: What will you always do with the initial value in the first step of solving and what new equation will you always be left with?     Find a formula for a power function such that and . First we note that . Thus, . We can substitute the other point and use logarithms to solve for : Thus the function of interest is approximately (due to approximating the logarithms) . Note: You should leave logarithmic expressions in exact form when possible; if you substitute decimal approximations at various steps of the problem, the error can propagate very quickly.     Answer the following questions about the last example:      What mistake in the last step of solving for might lead you to conclude ?      Once you know , how can you tell that must be less than one without actually solving for it?       "

  "body": " Graphical Transformations and Function Families     Describe horizontal and vertical shifts of graphs using addition and subtraction before or after (inside or outside) the application of a function.    Describe horizontal and vertical stretches of graphs using multiplication and division before or after (inside or outside) the application of a function.    Relate the effects of parameters in function families we have studied to graphical transformations.      In this section we discuss transformations of functions built out of the basic operations of arithmetic, applied to the inputs and\/or outputs of the function. Such transformations are called graphical transformations because they can be visualized as moving the graph of a parent function. The idea of graphical transformations brings together the concept of functions, as sequential processes applied to the inputs to yield the output, together with the geometric understanding of arithmetic presented in Chapter 1.    Basic Graphical Transformations  Graphical transformations have two fundamental types: inside transformations and outside transformations. An inside transformation is some sequence of operations applied to the input before the function is evaluated, whereas an outside transformation is a sequence of operations applied after the function. For these transformations to have graphical meaning, we restrict ourselves to the following operations, applied to the input and\/or output of a function ( will be called the parent function parent function :    We may add or subtract a positive constant to\/from , before is applied. Then we have a new function or .    We may multiply by a constant , before is applied. Then we have a new function .    We may add or subtract a positive constant to\/from , after evaluation. Then we have a new function or .    We may multiply by a constant , after evaluation. Then we have a new function .    In this list, the first two transformations are our basic inside transformations, the last two are our basic outside transformations.  Because outside transformations are easier to explain, we will start with them. Consider a generic function , whose graph is shown in the Desmos element below (Don't worry about what is; it was just made to give a random graph. You can modify it if you want.). By varying with the slider, describe how the graph changes under the transformation . The answer to why it works the way it does follows.   Effect of  If we build a new function , where is a positive number, each output is increased by . Hence, because of addition being represented as upward motion, the graph is shifted up by units. Likewise, if the new function is , the graph is shifted down by units (remember, we assumed was positive).     Let . What is the range of ? What is the range of when is any number (not necessarily just positive)? Explain. (You may us Desmos for this.)    Now we will move on to the effect of multiplication on the outside of a function. In the next Desmos graph, vary the value of in and describe the effect of the transformation of in your own words. You will probably need to give different descriptions for different values of .   Effect of  Suppose our parent function is and , then has a graph that is that of , except stretched away from the -axis by a factor of . This is due to the geometric representation of multiplication by numbers greater than one being represented as a stretch away from zero. Likewise, if , then the graph is compressed vertically by a factor of . If is negative, then the graph is first reflected across the -axis, then stretched or compressed by the magnitude of . This is due to our representation of multiplication by negative numbers as reflection, followed by a stretch or compression.     Suppose has a horizontal intercept at . Symbolically, this means . What happens to the location of this intercept when the function is transformed into ? Explain both graphically and symbolically.      Describe what happens to the -intercept of a function under the action of each of the basic outside transformations.    Now we will investigate and describe the effect of inside transformations. First, consider adding a positive number to , before is applied. This is the transformation . Again, investigate this transformation in the Desmos element and describe it in your own words, then read the textbook description.    Effect of  Because is added to before is applied, the output of , for any given , will be equal to the output of at a point units to the right of . Hence, we have the following:  The graph of is the graph of , except shifted units to the left.    Likewise, the graph of is that of , except shifted to the right by units.      This may seem counterintuitive at first, because adding should move things to the right. However, finding an -value for a given -value will involve solving for , which means the last step we will do is subtract, i.e. move to the left. For instance, consider the following example:   Let . One simple point on the graph of this function is , because . Now let's consider the new function . To find the transformed version of on the graph of , we must solve: Thus the transformed point is , which is two units to the left of .     Let . What is the domain of ? What is the domain of , where is a real number?    Finally, we consider multiplying by some number before applying the parent function . Explore the effect of the transformation with the following Desmos graph, then read the text description.   Effect of  Suppose is a parent function, and we want to see the effect of multiplying by some constant , before is applied. We have the following:    If , then for any given , the output of will be that of at a point that is a factor of further away from the -axis. Thus, when , the graph of is the graph of , except compressed by a factor of toward the -axis.    Likewise, the graph of is that of , except stretched away from the -axis by a factor of when (so ).    If is negative, the graph of is first reflected over the -axis, then compressed or stretched according to the absolute value of .       Suppose is on the graph of , that is . What point is on the graph of ? Explain both graphically and symbolically.      Function Families and Graphical Transformations  Some of our important forms for certain function families may be thought of as graphical transformations of some building block members of the given family.   Consider the basic linear function with slope , . The -intercept of this function is at . In order to obtain a new linear function whose graph passes through the point , we can perform a horizontal shift to the right by units and a vertical shift up by units to obtain This is simply the point-slope form for a line with slope passing through the point .    Consider a basic quadratic function , where is some given number. The vertex of its graph is at . In order to have the vertex occur at , we simply shift it to get This is the vertex form of a quadratic.      Suppose .  (a) Find a formula for in terms of the variable .    (b) Sketch a graph of on paper using graph transformations.  Select the letter of the graph A-E that matches your graph:   ?

The graph of    select    is    is not   the graph of reflected about the -axis.  The graph of is the graph of    select    stretched    shrunk   by a factor of units.  The graph of is the graph of shifted   select    down    up    units.
