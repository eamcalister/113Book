			<p>
				Linear function make up perhaps the most important class of functions in mathematics. Indeed, the basic premise of Calculus is to approximate more complicated functions with linear ones. However, despite their importance to higher mathematics, they come up in rather simple real world settings.
			</p>

<example>
			<statement>
				Fired Up Pizzeria charges <m>\$ 9.50</m> for a 12 inch pizza with no toppings, then an additional <m>\$ 1.50</m> per topping. Let's consider the function <m>C</m> that takes as an input the number of toppings, <m>n</m>, and gives the cost of a pizza, <m>C(n)</m>, in dollars. Construct a formula for this function and show its graph. 
			</statement>	
				
			<solution>	
				We first give a table of values for its outputs for several inputs:

				<table>
				<caption></caption>
				<tabular>
				<row header="yes">
					<cell halign="center"><m>n</m> toppings</cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>0</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>1</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>2</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>3</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>4</m></cell>
					<cell halign="left"></cell>
				</row>
				<row class="odd">
					<cell halign="center"><m>C(n)</m> dollars</cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>9.50</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>11.00</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>12.50</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>14.00</m></cell>
					<cell halign="right"><m>15.50</m></cell>
					<cell halign="left"></cell>
				</row>
				</tabular>
				</table>
			
			
			<p>
				The critical thing we notice in this table is that each time the input increases by one unit, an additional <m>\$ 1.50</m> is added to the cost. Hence, the number of times we add <m>1.50</m> to the initial (<m>n=0</m>) cost of <m>\$ 9.50</m> is equal to the input <m>n</m>. This process of repeated addition is precisely the definition of adding <m>1.5 n</m> to <m>9.5</m>, hence we have the formula <me>C(n) = 9.5 + 1.5 n.</me> Using the table and/or the formula, we may then graph <m>C</m>.

				In this picture we have plotted the graph between integer values of <m>n</m>, even though that may not make sense for this function, so that we can see the defining feature of the graph; it is a straight line. Due to the geometric properties of triangles, we see that the ratio of the change in the output divided by the change input is always equal to <m>1.5</m>. This value is called the <term>slope</term> of this line.

<example>
				<statement>
					Because a line is uniquely determined by two points, it is possible to find the formula for a linear function whose graph contains a given pair of points (provided the two points do not lie on a vertical line). For instance, suppose we are given that <m>(1,3)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m> are on the graph of <m>f(x) = mx +b</m>. Find the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>, and hence the formula for <m>f(x)</m>. 
				</statement>	
					
				<solution>	
					First we compute the slope: <me>m = \frac{4-3}{3-1} = \frac{1}{2}.</me> Then we use the facts that <m>f</m> is of the form <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x+b</m> and one of the two points is on the graph by substituting and solving for <m>b</m>: 
					
<md>
<mrow> 3  = \amp\ \frac{1}{2}\cdot 1 + b </mrow>
<mrow>  \updownarrow \amp </mrow>
<mrow> b  = \amp\ \frac{5}{2}. </mrow>
</md> 

Thus <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{5}{2}</m>. Another way to see how this process works is by noting that <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is added to the output for every extra unit of input. By starting at <m>(1,3)</m> and subtracting <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> once to get back to when <m>x=0</m>, we also get <m>b=f(0)=\frac{5}{2}</m>.

<question>
				<p>
					<em>In the last example, we noted that finding the formula for a linear function would not work if the line was vertical. Explain the following:</em>
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					<em>You cannot determine the slope of a vertical line from two points on that line.</em>
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					<em>The equation of a vertical line has the form <m>x=a</m>, where <m>a</m> is a number.</em>
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p>
</question>

				<p>
					In practical applications, one can often recognize linear functions by noting a constant rate of change parameter.
				</p>

<example>
				<statement>
					Suppose we wish to find a formula for the profit <m>P</m> of selling <m>q</m> widgets. This is the revenue we get from selling the widgets minus the cost of producing them. Suppose we sell the widgets for <m>\$ 35</m> a piece, and it costs <m>\$ 1000</m> to set up production, plus <m>\$ 15</m> to make each widget. 
				</statement>	

				<solution>	
					Observe that the units of <m>\$ /\text{widget}</m> on the selling price and production cost are both rates of change of the form <m>(\text{function output})/(\text{function input})</m>. This, along with the fact that these rates are constant, indicates the function is likely a linear function. Going to the formula we get <me>P = (\text{revenue}) - (\text{cost}) = 35q - (1000 + 15q).</me> This simplifies to the linear function <me>P = 20q - 1000.</me> Here we see that <m>\$ 1000</m> will be spent no matter how many widgets are sold, and we get a net profit of <m>\$ 20</m> for each widget sold.

				<title>Forms of Linear Functions</title>

				<p>
					The form <m>y = f(x) = mx + b</m> of a linear function is known as <em>slope-intercept form</em>. It is a very useful form. A more general (but non-unique) form is known as <term>point-slope form</term>.
				</p>

<definition xml:id="point_slope_form"><title>Point-Slope Form of a Linear Function</title><idx>point-slope form</idx>
				<p>
					The linear function of slope <m>m</m> passing through the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> has the form <me>y = f(x) = y_0 + m(x-x_0).</me>
				</p>
</definition>

				<p>
					In order to understand point-slope form, all you need to do is ask (and answer) the following two questions:
				</p>

				<p><ul>
					<li>
									<p>
					Is <m>f(x) = y_0 + m(x-x_0)</m> the formula for a linear function with slope <m>m</m>? The answer is yes. All one needs to do is simplify and collect like terms to see that <m>f(x) = mx + (y_0 - mx_0)</m>. Thus we can say <m>b = y_0 - mx_0</m>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Does the graph of <m>f(x) = y_0 + m(x-x_0)</m> pass through the point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>? Again the answer is yes because <m>f(x_0) = y_0 + m(x_0-x_0) = y_0</m>.
				</p>
					</li>

				</ul></p>

				<p>
					The graphical difference between point-slope form and slope-intercept form is that slope-intercept form puts on display the <m>y</m>-intercept, whereas slope-intercept form displays another point on the graph. Equipped with point-slope form, it is somewhat easier to find a formula for a linear function given two points; all you need to do is compute the slope.

<question>
				<p>
					<em>The slope-intercept form of the formula for a linear function is actually equal to the point-slope form for a specific point on the graph. What point is that?</em>
				</p>
</question>

				<p>
					Since the graphs of linear functions are lines, it makes sense to ask whether the two lines are parallel or perpendicular. To see whether two lines are parallel, they simply must have the same slope. So see whether two lines are perpendicular, consider the following figure:
				</p>

<figure xml:id="perp_lines">

				<p>
					From this (with triangles added to illustrate slope), we see that the magnitude of the change in <m>y</m> for an associated change in <m>x</m> on one graph is the same as the magnitude of the change in <m>x</m> for an associated change in <m>y</m> on the perpendicular graph. Also, the sign of the slope is opposite. Hence the slope of a line perpendicular to a line of slope <m>m</m> is <m>-\dfrac{1}{m}</m>.

				<title>Applications of Linear Functions</title>

				<p>
					Linear functions arise in real-world applications involving one variable that changes at a constant rate relative to another. Once the linear function is found, the problems usually boil down to
				</p>

				<p><ul>
					<li>
									<p>
					finding an output for a given input (evaluating),
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					finding the input for a given output (solving a simple equations), or
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					finding when two linear functions are equal (find when graphs intersect).
				</p>
					</li>

				</ul></p>

				<p>
					Each of these problems is actually relatively straightforward from an algebraic point of view, given that you have formulas for your functions. The main difficulty is turning the words of the real world into mathematics.
				</p>

<example xml:id="mountain_temp">
			<statement>
				<p>
					As one climbs a mountain, the air temperature decreases by about <m>3^{\circ}</m>F for every <m>1000</m> foot increase in elevation. Suppose the temperature is <m>60^{\circ}</m>F when at an elevation of <m>2000</m> feet above sea level. Suppose we want the answer to the following questions:
				</p>

				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					What will the temperature be at an elevation of <m>14,439</m> feet?

				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Our first task must be to find a formula for temperature as a function of elevation. To achieve this, we first have to name variables (this can be hard at first). Let <m>T</m> be the temperature, in <m>^{\circ}</m>F, at an elevation <m>h</m> feet above sea level. The problem describes a rate of change of <m>-3/1000</m> in <m>^{\circ}</m>F/ft; this will be the slope of our linear function. This slope can often be seen using the units as the units of slope must be output units divided by input units. The sign is negative because the temperature decreases at this rate as <m>h</m> increases. The problem then describes a point on the graph of this function, <m>(2000,60)</m>. Using point-slope form, we have <me>T = -\frac{3}{1000}(h-2000) + 60.</me> The answer to part (a) is then obtained by substituting <m>14,493</m> for <m>h</m> to get <me>T = -\frac{3}{1000}(14493-2000) + 60\approx 22.521^{\circ}\mbox{F}.</me> To answer part (b), we need to substitute <m>65</m> for <m>T</m>, and solve for <m>h</m>:
