<introduction>
		<p>
			An <em>algebraic equation</em> is a pair of algebraic expressions connected by an equals sign. An equation may or may not be true for specific values of the variables. Variable values that make the equation true are known as <em>solutions</em> to the equation. One of the basic tasks in the study of algebra is to find solutions to algebraic equations. In this chapter we will give an overview of some basic techniques of solving equations. We will give more geometric meaning to these solutions when we introduce the concept of the graph of a function in Chapter 4 (see <xref ref="graphical_algebra"/>).
