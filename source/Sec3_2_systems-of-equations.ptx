				What if we need to solve an equation with more than one variable? For instance, consider the equation <me>x+3y  = 0.</me> For such an equation, a solution is a <em>pair</em> of numbers, an <m>x</m>-value and a <m>y</m>-value, that make the equation true when they are both plugged in at the same time. We see that if <m>y=1</m>, then <m>x=-3</m> makes the equation true. If <m>y=2</m>, then the correct value for <m>x</m> is <m>-6</m>. Clearly we could go on like this, obtaining a different value of <m>x</m> for any given value of <m>y</m>. There is no way for us to say that this equation has a single solution; it has infinitely many. Often in problems the number of solutions is narrowed down by having more equations, which we call a <em>system of equations</em>. For instance, we may consider the system 
				<me>
				\begin{aligned}
				x+3y \amp = \amp 0\\
				2x-y \amp = \amp 1.
				\end{aligned}
				</me> 
				A solution to this system of two equations is again a pair of numbers, one for each variable, that make all the equations true at the same time. For instance <m>x=-3</m> and <m>y=1</m> is not a solution to this system; this pair makes the first equation true, but not the second. The pair <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=1</m> makes the second equation true, but not the first, so this is also not a solution to the system.**

				So how do we find solutions to systems? The most flexible way of solving systems of equations is known as the method of substitution.

				<title>Substitution to Solve Systems of Equations</title>
			<p>	
			To solve a system of equations
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Pick an equation and solve it for one of the variables in terms of the others.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Substitute the expression from the step above into the remaining equations.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now the remaining equations form a system with one fewer variables and one fewer equations.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Repeat until you just have one equation and one variable that you can solve for.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Finally, back substitute the value you found to know the other variables.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
</algorithm>

				Let's see this at work with the system given above. Using the first equation, we can solve for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m> as follows: 
				
<md>
<mrow> x+3y \amp = \amp 0</mrow>
<mrow> \amp \updownarrow \amp </mrow>
<mrow> x \amp = \amp -3y.</mrow>
</md> 


Now we substitute <m>-3y</m> every time we see an <m>x</m> in the second equation and solve for <m>y</m>: 

<md>
<mrow>2(-3y) - y \amp = \amp 1</mrow>
<mrow> \amp \updownarrow \amp </mrow>
<mrow> -7y \amp = \amp 1 </mrow>
<mrow> \amp \updownarrow \amp </mrow>
<mrow> y \amp = \amp -\frac{1}{7}. </mrow>
</md> 

Now we have <m>y=-\frac{1}{7}</m>, hence <m>x = -3y = \frac{3}{7}</m>. We can now check to make sure we obtained a correct solution by plugging these values into the original system: 

<md>
<mrow> \frac{3}{7} +3\left(\frac{-1}{7}\right) \amp = \amp \frac{3}{7}-\frac{3}{7} = 0 \checkmark </mrow>
<mrow> 2\left(\frac{3}{7}\right) - \frac{-1}{7} \amp = \amp \frac{6}{7}+\frac{1}{7} = 1 \checkmark </mrow>

<example>
			<statement>
				Sometimes we need to solve a system of equations in order to manipulate an expression into another form. For instance, an important type of manipulation in Calculus and Differential Equations is known as the <term>Partial Fraction Decomposition</term>. In this manipulation, we take a single fraction and split it as a sum of pieces with simpler, but different, denominators. For instance, let's write <me>\frac{4}{(x-1)(x+2)}</me> in the form <me>\frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x+2}</me> for some numbers <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. 
			</statement>
<solution>				
These two expressions are to be equivalent for all values of <m>x</m>, we need to solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. To do this, set the expressions equal to one another and do some manipulations. 
<md>
<mrow>\frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x+2} \amp = \amp \frac{4}{(x-1)(x+2)}</mrow>
<mrow> \amp \updownarrow \amp (\text{combine fractions on left})</mrow>
<mrow>\frac{A(x+2) + B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+2)} \amp = \amp \frac{4}{(x-1)(x+2)}</mrow>
<mrow> \amp \updownarrow \amp (\text{simplify the expression on the left})</mrow>
<mrow>\frac{(A+B)x + 2A -B}{(x-1)(x+2)} \amp = \amp \frac{4}{(x-1)(x+2)}.</mrow>
</md> 

Now we set the numerators equal: 
<me>
(A+B)x + 2A-B = 4.
</me> 
Note that like terms are grouped on both sides. Since there are zero <m>x</m>'s on the right, we must have <m>A+B = 0</m>. Since <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are numbers, we must have <m>2A-B = 4</m>. Thus we have a system of equations 
<md>
<mrow>A+B \amp = \amp 0</mrow>
<mrow>2A-B \amp = \amp 4.</mrow>
</md> 

Using the first equation we have <m>B = -A</m>. Substituting into the second equation we see <m>3A = 4</m>. Hence, <m>A = \frac{4}{3}</m> and <m>B=-\frac{4}{3}</m>.
</solution>
