    <title>Features of the Text</title>
    <p>
      Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
      including:

            As much as possible,
            we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
            and to encourage students to do the same.

            and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.

            Many of the ideas of how functions behave are best understood dynamically;
            applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations.
            <em>Desmos</em> provides a free and easy-to-use online graphing utility that we occasionally link to and often direct students to use.
