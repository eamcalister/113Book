    <p>
      I look forward to any and all suggestions for improvement.

    <title>Features of the Text</title>
    <p>
      Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation,
      including:
      <dl width="narrow">
        <li>
          <title>Section Objectives</title>
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>



        <li>
          <title>Exercises</title>
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>

        <!--li>
          <title>Graphics</title>
          <p>
            As much as possible,
            we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually,
            and to encourage students to do the same.
            Throughout the text, we use full-color<fn>To keep cost low,
            the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white.
            When the text itself refers to color in images,
            one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.</fn> graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas,
            and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.
          </p>
        </li-->

        <!--li>
          <title>Interactive graphics</title>
          <p>
            Many of the ideas of how functions behave are best understood dynamically;
            applets offer an often ideal format for investigations and demonstrations.
            <em>Desmos</em> provides a free and easy-to-use online graphing utility that we occasionally link to and often direct students to use.  Thanks to David Austin, there are also select interactive javascript figures within the text itself.
          </p>
        </li-->

        <!--li>
          <title>Summary of Key Ideas</title>
          <p>
            Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section;
            this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.
