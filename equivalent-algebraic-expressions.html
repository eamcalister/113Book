</h2>
<p id="p-285">Two algebraic expressions are called <em class="emphasis">equivalent if they yield the same output no matter what is substituted into them. Thinking of algebraic expressions procedurally, we have the following characterization of equivalent algebraic expressions:</em></p>
<p id="p-286">Equivalent Expressions as Different Processes with the Same Result</p>
<p id="p-287"><em class="emphasis">Equivalent Algebraic Expressions</em> <span class="process-math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <em class="emphasis">Equivalent algebraic expressions are symbolic representations of different processes performed on the variables that always give the same end result.</em></p>
<p id="p-288">People who are good at algebra often speak of manipulating/simplifying algebraic expressions and putting expressions into different forms. What they are talking about is replacing an expression with an equivalent expression. The reason for manipulating expressions is that sometimes one version of an expression makes it easier to see a solution to a problem. For instance, the expression used to find the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C given the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{160}{9},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C. Suppose we want to know what temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(O^{\circ}\)</span>C. Even if you already know the answer is <span class="process-math">\(32^{\circ}\)</span>F, the given expression does not make it obvious. However, the given expression is equivalent to the following:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now the solution is more clear; if we substitute <span class="process-math">\(F=32\)</span> into the expression for <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{9}(32-32) = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-289">Why are these two expressions equivalent? The answer here comes from the arithmetic rule known as the distributive law (to be discussed more later). We can take the second expression and distribute the <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{9}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{5}{9}(F-32)  = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{5}{9}\cdot 32 = \frac{5}{9}F-\frac{160}{9}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-290">Another example of equivalent expressions is give by Example <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "E:recip" missing or not unique]</code>. In this case, we used the fact that the expression <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2}{x+1}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(2 \cdot \frac{1}{x+1}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-291">Fundamentally, since algebraic expressions are built using the operations of arithmetic, equivalence of algebraic expressions is determined by using rules of arithmetic. We will discuss the most commonly used ways of manipulating expressions into equivalent ones in the remainder of this section. However, we will first discuss how to tell if two expressions are inequivalent.</p>
<section class="subsection" id="inequivalent-expressions"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">2.2.1</span> <span class="title">Inequivalent Expressions</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-292">Two expressions are not equivalent if there are some values of the variables in the expression that yield different numbers when you substitute. So, if you plug the same number into two expressions and get different results, then the two expressions are inequivalent (assuming you did the arithmetic correctly). With practice, you’ll get good at being able to detect inequivalent expressions without even needing to substitute anything. For now, we’ll look at some important examples that sometimes trip people up.</p>
<p id="p-293"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.10</dfn>. The two expressions <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2\)</span> are  equivalent. One may detect this by noting the order in which operations are performed on <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> In one expression you add the two variables, then square. In the other, you square each variable, then add. Based one our experience with order of operations (order matters), we think these may not be equivalent. It turns out that if you pick any two numbers for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> as long as neither is zero, these two expressions will evaluate to different numbers. For instance, if we substitute <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=2\text{,}\)</span> then the first expression gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(1+2)^2 = 3^2 =9,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">whereas the second expression gives</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1^2+2^2 = 1+4 = 5.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">It is also possible to see that these two expressions are inequivalent by giving the geometric representations. We begin by thinking of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as lengths. Then <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span> is the area of a square whose side length is <span class="process-math">\(x+y\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span> is the sum of areas of squares that fit inside the square of side length <span class="process-math">\(x+y\)</span> as in the following diagram:</p>
<p id="p-294">In this figure we see that the total shaded area is <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span> while the area of the entire square is <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\text{.}\)</span> If you note that the unshaded portions of the square each have area <span class="process-math">\(xy\text{,}\)</span> we can see that <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span>  equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(x^2+2xy+y^2\text{.}\)</span> We will see this more symbolically in the section on distributing, expanding, and factoring.</p>
<p id="p-295"><dfn class="terminology">Question 2.11</dfn>. <em class="emphasis">Explain why <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)</span> is not equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(a+b\text{.}\)</span> Do this both by plugging in numbers and by either referring to the last example, or using the Pythagorean Theorem to explain the inequivalence geometrically.</em></p>
<p id="p-296"><dfn class="terminology">Question 2.12</dfn>. <em class="emphasis">Use volumes to give a geometric explanation of why <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^3\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+y^3\text{,}\)</span> but is not equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(x^3+y^3\text{.}\)</span></em></p>
<p id="p-297"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.13</dfn>. <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{3}\)</span> is  equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2}{x+3}\text{.}\)</span> A simple, but perhaps not helpful, reason is because that’s not how you add fractions. Let’s make sure we really see that this is not how you add fractions. First substitute <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> Then the first expression evaluates to</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{3}=1+\frac{1}{3},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">while the second evaluates to</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Even if you forget how to add fractions you can tell these are not equal. The first one is larger than one and the second is smaller than one.</p>
<p id="p-298"><dfn class="terminology">Remark:</dfn> It is important to note that for two expressions to be equivalent, they must evaluate to the same number for  values of the variables, not just some. For instance, in the example with squares, if <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> the two expressions do evaluate to the same thing. However, this does not make the expressions equivalent.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="reordering-and-regrouping"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-299">Sometimes the order in which operations are performed in an algebraic expression doesn’t affect the result. Specifically, if the expression only involves addition, order of operations doesn’t tell you which one to do first because it doesn’t matter. Likewise for multiplication. Specifically, we have the following rules for addition and multiplication:</p>
<p id="p-300"><dfn class="terminology">Commutative and Associative Laws for Addition and Multiplication</dfn></p>
<ul id="p-301" class="disc">
<li id="li-129"><p id="p-302"><span class="process-math">\(a+b = b+a\)</span> (addition is commutative)</p></li>
<li id="li-130"><p id="p-303"><span class="process-math">\(ab=ba\)</span> (multiplication is commutative)</p></li>
<li id="li-131"><p id="p-304"><span class="process-math">\(a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c\)</span> (addition is associative)</p></li>
<li id="li-132"><p id="p-305"><span class="process-math">\(a(bc)=(ab)c\)</span> (multiplication is associative)</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-306">In Chapter 1 you were asked to explain the commutativity of addition geometrically using lengths on the number line (Question 1). To explain the commutativity of multiplication, we think of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> as lengths of the sides of a rectangle. Using the fact that the area of a rectangle is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{Area} = \mbox{base}\times\mbox{height},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">we can arrange our rectangle with <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> on the bottom and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> on the side to get the area to be <span class="process-math">\(ab\text{.}\)</span> If we simply rotate the rectangle <span class="process-math">\(90\)</span> degrees, the are is then seen as <span class="process-math">\(ba\text{.}\)</span> Since rotation doesn’t change the area, we must have <span class="process-math">\(ab = ba\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-307"><dfn class="terminology">Question 2.14</dfn>. <em class="emphasis">Now we would like geometric explanations of the associative laws.</em></p>
<ol id="p-308" class="decimal">
<li id="li-133"><p id="p-309"><em class="emphasis">Explain the associative law for addition using lengths on the number line.</em></p></li>
<li id="li-134"><p id="p-310"><em class="emphasis">Explain the associative law for multiplication using the fact that the volume of a rectangular prism is the area of its base multiplied by its height (similar to our explanation of the commutative law for multiplication).</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-311">These rules are most useful in simplifying complex expressions that involve many terms being added together or multiplied.</p>
<p id="p-312"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.15</dfn>. Suppose you have two cans, both are <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> inches tall, but one has a diameter that it three times that of the other one. Let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> denote the diameter of the smaller can, in inches. Suppose we would like to find a simplified expression for the total volume of the two cans in terms of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> First we note the formula for the volume of a cylinder: <span class="process-math">\(V=\pi r^2h\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the radius and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the height. Since both cans have a height of <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> inches, we substitute <span class="process-math">\(h = 5\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(r= \frac{d}{2}\text{,}\)</span> the volume of the first can is then given by <span class="process-math">\(\pi\cdot\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2\cdot 5\text{.}\)</span> Using associativity and commutativity, this simplifies to</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{volume of smaller can} = \frac{5}{4}\pi d^2\ \mbox{in}^3.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since the diameter of the larger can is three times that of the smaller can, its radius is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3d}{2}\text{,}\)</span> which makes its volume</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{volume of larger can} = \pi\cdot\left(\frac{3d}{2}\right)^2\cdot 5 = \frac{45}{4} \pi d^2\ \mbox{in}^3.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Adding them together we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\mbox{Total Volume} = \frac{5}{4}\pi d^2 + \frac{45}{4}\pi d^2 = \frac{25}{2}\pi d^2\ \mbox{in}^3.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-313">In the last step of the last example we performed an important type of regrouping known as <em class="emphasis">combining like terms. This is when all the terms with the same algebraic type (same exponents on a variable for example) are combined into a single term by adding together the constants by which they are multiplied. It is important to note that terms can only be combined when the only difference between them is a constant multiplier. For instance,<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
3x^2 + 4\sqrt{x} + 5x^2 - \sqrt{9x} = 8x^2+4\sqrt{x}-3\sqrt{x} = 8x^2+\sqrt{x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>The remaining terms cannot be combined further because one has an exponent of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> while the other has an exponent of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span></em></p>
<p id="p-314"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.16</dfn>. Let’s see another reason unlike terms can’t be combined. Consider the expression <span class="process-math">\(4x^3+ 6x\text{.}\)</span> To make it more meaningful, we may think of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a length with units of meters. Then <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> represents a volume in cubic meters. Because of dimensional considerations, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> cannot be combined in a meaningful way. In order for this expression to make any practical sense when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in meters, the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> needs to be in square meters. However, then the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> is dimensionless, while the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> represents an area. We cannot add the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> since they represent different units. So thinking of <span class="process-math">\(4x^3 + 6x\)</span> as representing some geometric quantity shows that it cannot be simplified any further.</p>

<p id="p-320">One of the most important rules in constructing equivalent algebraic expressions is the Distributive Law.</p>
<p id="p-321"><dfn class="terminology">The Distributive Law</dfn> For any <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a(b+c) = ab+ac.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-322">This fact asserts that you can</p>
<ul id="p-323" class="disc">
<li id="li-137"><p id="p-324">add two lengths, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> on the line together, then expand/compress by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> or</p></li>
<li id="li-138"><p id="p-325">expand/contract each of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> then add the results together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-326">The end result is the same in either case. Many seemingly complex algebraic manipulations boil down to using the distributive law several times and collecting like terms; it’s just that <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> may be some sort of algebraic expressions.</p>
<p id="p-327"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.19</dfn>. Let’s find the expanded form of <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2\)</span> using the distributive law.</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^2 &amp; = &amp; (x+y)(x+y)\\
&amp; = &amp; (x+y)x + (x+y)y  \phantom{www} \mbox{the distributive law}\\
&amp; = &amp; (x^2+xy) + (xy+y^2) \phantom{wn} \mbox{more distributive law}\\
&amp; = &amp; x^2+2xy+y^2 \phantom{wwwwwwi} \mbox{combining like terms}\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-328"><dfn class="terminology">Question 2.20</dfn>. <em class="emphasis">Describe what each term in the second and third lines of the manipulation given above represents geometrically as areas, as in the example in the last section showing <span class="process-math">\((x+y)^2 = x^2+2xy+y^2\text{.}\)</span></em></p>
<p id="p-329"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.21</dfn>. Subtraction of quantities in parentheses is often simplified using the distributive law and remembering that subtraction is really just addition of <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> times the given quantity. For instance, suppose we want to simplify the expression</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
3x^2 - (4x+2x^2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">First, re-write it with addition and <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> multiplying the piece in parentheses, then apply the distributive law:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
3x^2 - (4x+2x^2) &amp; = &amp; 3x^2 + (-1)(4x+2x^2)\\
\ &amp; = &amp; 3x^2+((-1)4x+(-1)2x^2)\\
\ &amp; = &amp; 3x^2-4x-2x^2\\
\ &amp; = &amp; x^2-4x.\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">With practice, you probably won’t need to write this many steps down. This process is often referred to as “distributing a minus sign”.</p>
<p id="p-330">Now is probably a good time to just get a little practice expanding/distributing and collecting like terms. Just remember the distributive law and you’ll see it’s not that hard.</p>
<p id="p-331"><dfn class="terminology">Question 2.22</dfn>. <em class="emphasis">Expand (write as an equivalent expression without parentheses) each of the following expressions and collect like terms:</em></p>
<ol id="p-332" class="decimal">
<li id="li-139"><p id="p-333"><em class="emphasis"><span class="process-math">\(3ab(2a-5b)\)</span></em></p></li>
<li id="li-140"><p id="p-334"><em class="emphasis"><span class="process-math">\((2x+1)(3x-4)\)</span></em></p></li>
<li id="li-141"><p id="p-335"><em class="emphasis"><span class="process-math">\(3x^2(1-x)^3\)</span></em></p></li>
<li id="li-142"><p id="p-336"><em class="emphasis"><span class="process-math">\(2x-\frac{1}{3}x(5-3x-2x^2)\)</span></em></p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-337">Now we will go backward from expanding/distributing. This process is known as factoring. When we expand an expression, we write it as an equivalent expression that is a sum of simple terms that each only involve multiplication and/or division. To <em class="emphasis">factor an expression means to write it as a product of simple terms. For example, earlier in this chapter we had two expressions for the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C in terms of the temperature in <span class="process-math">\(^{\circ}\)</span>F. The expression <span class="process-math">\(C = \frac{5}{9}F - \frac{160}{9}\)</span> is in expanded form, while <span class="process-math">\(C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)\)</span> is in factored form. Factored forms of expressions are often useful for solving equations as we’ll see in the next chapter. Factoring isn’t something that can be done in all cases by a single procedure; the following are just a few examples of common factoring methods.</em></p>
<p id="p-338"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.23</dfn>. When each term of an expression is divisible by some common factor one can “un-distribute” that factor. For instance, if we are given the expression</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
12xy+6y^2+3y^3,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">we can see that each term contains <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> as a factor. This means we can factor <span class="process-math">\(3y\)</span> out of the expression to get the equivalent expression</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
3y(4x+2y+y^2).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that you can check your answer by applying the distributive law. An interpretation of pulling out a common factor like this is that each term is being stretched/compressed by the same amount, hence we can think of this as a single entity being stretched/compressed, which may be simpler.</p>
<p id="p-339"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.24</dfn>. Expressions of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax^2+bx+c\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are constants are known as <dfn class="terminology">quadratic</dfn> expressions in the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Factoring such expressions is a very common and useful algebraic task. It is possible to give a procedure for factoring quadratics, but right now it is best to proceed with examples and practice. For instance, consider the expression</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
12x^2+5x-2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We wish to re-write this expression in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(rx+p)(sx+q).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We note that</p>
<ul id="p-340" class="disc">
<li id="li-143"><p id="p-341"><span class="process-math">\(rs\)</span> must equal <span class="process-math">\(12\text{,}\)</span></p></li>
<li id="li-144"><p id="p-342"><span class="process-math">\(pq\)</span> must equal <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{,}\)</span> and</p></li>
<li id="li-145"><p id="p-343"><span class="process-math">\(rq + ps\)</span> must equal <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-344">Some trial and error leads us to</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(3x+2)(4x-1),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which we may check by expanding.</p>
<p id="p-345"><dfn class="terminology">Example 2.25</dfn>. Any expression of the form <span class="process-math">\(a^2-b^2\)</span> may be factored as <span class="process-math">\((a+b)(a-b)\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> may represent more complicated expressions in this). One may check this using the distributive law. To see how this factorization works geometrically, consider the following figure with <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> being thought of as a number smaller than <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-346">In this figure the entire square has an area of <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> units and the gray shaded area has an area of <span class="process-math">\(a^2-b^2\)</span> units. Each of the smaller shaded rectangles has area <span class="process-math">\(b(a-b)\)</span> and the lower right shaded square has an area of <span class="process-math">\((a-b)(a-b)\text{.}\)</span> Hence the total shaded area is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a-b) + 2b(a-b).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now each term has a common factor of <span class="process-math">\((a-b)\text{,}\)</span> hence we may factor it off and simplify by collecting like terms:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
a^2-b^2 &amp; = &amp; (a-b)(a-b) + 2b(a-b)\\
\ &amp; = &amp; (a-b)(a-b+2b)\\
\ &amp; = &amp; (a-b)(a+b).\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-347">One may also see this factorization geometrically by taking the shaded rectangle on top and moving it to the left hand side of the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-348">Now we have a single shaded rectangle whose height is <span class="process-math">\(a-b\)</span> and whose width is <span class="process-math">\(a+b\text{,}\)</span> hence the total area is <span class="process-math">\((a-b)(a+b)\text{.}\)</span></p>
